What are your plans for growth? Some site builders charge more as you add more products. Think about what your business needs to launch today, but also consider how many products you’ll offer down the road. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Website-building skill level.<span> </span></strong>How much technical skill do you have? Many builders use drag-and-drop technology to help you create the<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/best-ecommerce-sites">best ecommerce site</a>, but you’ll still need basic skills to create product pages, add products to your store, and set up any apps or plug-ins. Consider how much experience you have working with software and back-end builders. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Customization.<span> </span></strong>Do you want a simple website to showcase your products? Or do you need more advanced features like adding size charts to product pages and adding a live chat window? Think about how you want your website to look and feel and what extra features you need to make it happen. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Support.<span> </span></strong>If you’re newer to building an ecommerce website, you’ll likely need some help. Does your desired site builder have live support and tutorials? Consider a platform that can help you solve problems quickly and easily, so you can get your store live and start selling online. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment gateways.<span> </span></strong>You need payment gateways to accept payments from customers securely and to make payments easy for shoppers. For example, Shop Pay’s express checkout feature can<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/shop-pay-checkout">increase checkout speed by four times</a><span> </span>and help customers get what they want, faster. Shopify also offers integrations with over 100 payment gateways, so you can offer the best options for your shoppers, no matter where they are in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Find the best website builder for your business</h2>\n<p>Now that you know your options when looking for the best ecommerce website builder, it’s time to test them out. Each option comes with its own pros and cons, but hopefully you have a better idea of which store builder is best for your business. </p>\n<p>A professional ecommerce website can take your business to the next level. With all these free website builder options available, there’s no doubt you’ll find the best one to build an online store that you’re proud of, impresses customers, and makes sales for you automatically. </p>\n<p><em>Illustration by Till Lauer</em></p>',

You can build an ecommerce website for free, but you can’t sell anything until you upgrade to a paid plan. </p>\n<p>Wix has a few helpful tools to manage your ecommerce business.

GoDaddy offers built-in tools for search engine optimization and email marketing campaigns but lacks depth in its features.

What are your plans for growth? Some site builders charge more as you add more products. Think about what your business needs to launch today, but also consider how many products you’ll offer down the road. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Website-building skill level.<span> </span></strong>How much technical skill do you have? Many builders use drag-and-drop technology to help you create the<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/best-ecommerce-sites">best ecommerce site</a>, but you’ll still need basic skills to create product pages, add products to your store, and set up any apps or plug-ins. Consider how much experience you have working with software and back-end builders. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Customization.<span> </span></strong>Do you want a simple website to showcase your products? Or do you need more advanced features like adding size charts to product pages and adding a live chat window? Think about how you want your website to look and feel and what extra features you need to make it happen. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Support.<span> </span></strong>If you’re newer to building an ecommerce website, you’ll likely need some help. Does your desired site builder have live support and tutorials? Consider a platform that can help you solve problems quickly and easily, so you can get your store live and start selling online. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment gateways.<span> </span></strong>You need payment gateways to accept payments from customers securely and to make payments easy for shoppers. For example, Shop Pay’s express checkout feature can<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/shop-pay-checkout">increase checkout speed by four times</a><span> </span>and help customers get what they want, faster. Shopify also offers integrations with over 100 payment gateways, so you can offer the best options for your shoppers, no matter where they are in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Find the best website builder for your business</h2>\n<p>Now that you know your options when looking for the best ecommerce website builder, it’s time to test them out.

They launched in February 2021 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and have only grown since, adding new products and seeking further investment to keep up with demand.</p>\n<p>Sustainability is at the heart of Pantee and plays a role in every part of its supply chain. The brand’s challenge is staying true to that ideal while scaling up.</p>\n<h3>Matt Mundt, Founder of<span> </span><a href="https://hugsleep.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hug Sleep</a>\n</h3>\n<figure>\n<figure><img alt="Matt Mundt on Shark Tank" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Screen_Shot_2022-03-15_at_2.39.23_PM.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647369740" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Screen_Shot_2022-03-15_at_2.39.23_PM.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647369740">\n<figcaption>Photo courtesy of:<span> </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ_2gIg18Ho" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sony Pictures Television</a></figcaption>\n<p>Matt started Hug Sleep with an idea, a dream of entrepreneurship, and $2,500. The Hug Sleep is known as the blanket that hugs you back—a cozy, soothing experience based on the science of weighted blankets. The company has exploded since Matt founded it, thanks in part to<span> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/NQ_2gIg18Ho" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an appearance on<span> </span><em>Shark Tank</em></a>, where he and his wife, Angie, walked away with a $300,000 investment. </p>\n<p>Matt has had to grapple with a rapid increase in demand for what started as a solo venture he worked on after his corporate job ended for the day.</p>\n<h2 id="2">Signs you’re ready for the next stage of growth</h2>\n<p>Growth doesn’t just need the right plan, but the right timing. Growing too quickly can lead to expenses you can’t pay, employees you don’t actually need, or a supply chain that’s grown out of control. Conversely, not scaling at the right time could mean orders you can’t fulfill and tasks going unfinished.</p>\n<p>Here are a few questions to ask yourself to help you decide if it’s time to make a plan for sustainable scaling.</p>\n<h3>Are you ready for the next step in entrepreneurship?</h3>\n<p>You should only take your business to the next step if you’re truly ready for a bigger enterprise. Scaling up means your company is going to take more time, resources, and expertise that you have to be prepared to give. Scaling up is an exciting time, but you’ll need a level head to get it done in a way that’s sustainable for your business. </p>\n<p>Ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Are you ready to take on more strategic challenges?</strong><span> </span>That could mean expanding your product lines or selling globally.</li>\n<li><strong>Will you be able to dedicate more time to your business without other parts of your life suffering?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Do you have the financial resources available that you’ll need?</strong></li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do you need outside help?</strong><span> </span>You may be at a point where having someone else handle marketing or customer service would make your day easier.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do you need more employees to get the work done?</strong><span> </span>Struggling to make your business work with your current team—which might be a mighty team of one!—is a great sign that it’s time to scale up. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Are you having trouble keeping up with orders?</strong><span> </span>Having a higher volume than your business is prepared to handle means falling behind on packaging and deliveries, customer service gaps, and a whole lot of stress for you. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Are you falling behind on inventory?</strong><span> </span>If you’re constantly finding yourself sold out, with customers clamoring for restocks, it’s definitely time to scale up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, some businesses are meant to be small businesses. It’s OK if you want your side hustle to remain a side hustle. It all comes down to your personal priorities, lifestyle, and financial situation. </p>\n<h2 id="3">6 steps to scale your business</h2>\n<p>There’s no one formula for scaling a business, because every business—and founder—has unique strengths and challenges. Scaling up a clothing business, for example, is going to look different from scaling up a skin care empire. But there are some common threads to consider:</p>\n<h3>1. Make a plan for your future</h3>\n<p>If your company<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/hobby-to-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started as a hobby</a>, like in Matt’s case with Hug Sleep, you may have just been going with the flow up until this point. </p>\n<p>However, to scale sustainably, you need a business plan. It will not only help you understand your business, but it will be something you’ll need to show if you ever seek out outside investment. </p>\n<p>There are different ways to format a business plan, but a basic one should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Executive summary</li>\n<li>Company description</li>\n<li>Market analysis</li>\n<li>Management and organization</li>\n<li>Products and services</li>\n<li>Customer segmentation</li>\n<li>Marketing plan</li>\n<li>Logistics and operations plan</li>\n<li>Financial plan</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular, you’ll be creating a strategic marketing plan, with a forecast for the future outlining your plans for growth. What’s a realistic revenue goal for a year from now? What about five years from now? What’s your plan for increasing your marketing capacity?</p>\n<p>“That was actually a really valuable part of the process for us—sitting down and saying, ‘Where do we want to be? Where do we want to be in five years? What do we see from this business? And where do we think it can go?’” says Katie.</p>\n<figure><img alt="Pantee underwear and bras modelled by women of different sizes and ages" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Pantee_Collection_1de044c2-7fe9-4939-aaa7-2275c0ddfc2b.jpg?v=1647034791" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Pantee_Collection_1de044c2-7fe9-4939-aaa7-2275c0ddfc2b.jpg?v=1647034791">\n<figcaption>Photo courtesy of:<span> </span><a href="https://pantee.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pantee</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>“I think that, from day one, we’ve really felt that Pantee has huge potential to become a household name brand.”</p>\n<p>Nail down where your business is right now, as well as where you want your business to go. Use the resources below to get started and consider the next steps in scaling as you create your plan.</p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">\n<p>📚<span> </span><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/business-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Write the Perfect Business Plan in 9 Steps</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/business-plan-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Plan Template: A Practical Framework for Creating Your Business Plan</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/business-plan-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 Business Plan Examples to Help Write Your Own</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>2. Evaluate your supply chain</h3>\n<p>Scaling up means a higher volume of sales and your supply chain needs to be equipped to handle that. What works right now might not work as well at scale.</p>\n<p>Pantee, for example, was originally inspired by creating underwear from thrifted t-shirts. They then turned to dead-stock t-shirts, but they can actually be slower to process. Already-made shirts take longer to cut and evaluate for quality, so the brand has since expanded its source materials.</p>\n<p>“We don’t just use the dead-stock T-shirts, we also use dead-stock rolls of fabric,” says Katie. “It’s the exact same grade of material, it’s just taken at a different point in the supply chain.”The fabric rolls allow for faster production but with the same commitment to sustainability. It’s even become a feature—getting their hands on a particular color lets them create a limited time collection drop that customers snap up.</p>\n<p>Pantee goods are manufactured in Bangladesh at a factory with working conditions that Katie and Amanda vetted, but going overseas might not be the right move for your supply chain.</p>\n<p>Matt scaled Hug Sleep while remaining with the same manufacturer in his home state of Wisconsin. In fact, a more local approach<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/supply-chain-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can help ease the stress</a><span> </span>that the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on global supply chains.</p>\n<p>In either case, evaluate whether your<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/13975985-how-to-find-a-manufacturer-or-supplier-for-your-product-idea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current sourcing and manufacturing processes</a><span> </span>still function well at scale. If not, you’ll need to figure out<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/dropshipping-fulfillment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next steps</a>.</p>\n<h3>3. Hire strategically</h3>\n<p>Scaling up means you may no longer be able to do everything yourself, or with whoever you’ve recruited so far to make your business work. </p>\n<p>Katie says Pantee has been running for the last year or so with just her and her sister as full-timers, supported by contractors. With a round of investment under their belts, Pantee is about to take on its first full-time employee.</p>\n<p>Specifically though, they decided the most impactful choice was to hire someone to take care of brand and community management.</p>\n<p>“Our strategy is very heavy on influencer marketing, ambassador marketing, and our partnerships, and it’s a very, very time consuming element of the business,” says Katie. Taking that workload off Katie and Amanda means more time back to focus on the core of the business.</p>\n<p>If hiring is part of your scaling strategy, you should hire where an extra person would be most effective. For Pantee, it was marketing, but for your business it could be someone to work on product or<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/hiring-for-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer service</a>, or sales. Employees are a major financial commitment, so they should be focus on an area that will bring in the most return.</p>\n<p>“We’re really excited to see what we can do sort of with an extra 40 hours a week put toward the business,” says Katie.</p>\n<h3>4. Outsource for efficiency</h3>\n<p>If it doesn’t make sense to hire your own employee, there are ways to outsource tasks to streamline your business as you scale. Matt, for example, doesn’t have any full-time employees. Instead, he uses an agency to handle all his marketing because he realized it was something a third-party would be better at.</p>\n<p>“My background is in mechanical engineering,” he says. “I’m a numbers guy and a data guy. I thought there’s no challenge that I can’t get over.” So Matt tried to teach himself how to launch ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Google.</p>\n<p>“I tried, and it didn’t work all that well.”</p>\n<figure><img alt="A model wrapped in a Hug Sleep blanket" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/hugsleep.jpg?v=1647034861" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/hugsleep.jpg?v=1647034861">\n<figcaption>Photo courtesy of:<span> </span><a href="https://hugsleep.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hug Sleep</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>By talking to agencies, Matt finally realized that they could create a more sophisticated campaign than he could, so he outsourced.</p>\n<p>He also hit a wall on<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/fulfillment-analytics-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order fulfillment</a>. He used to pack all the orders himself and drop them off at the post office on his lunch breaks. But that doesn’t work at scale. He now uses the<span> </span><a href="https://www.shopify.com/fulfillment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify Fulfillment Network</a><span> </span>to do the heavy lifting.</p>\n<p>Whether hiring an agency or an employee, you should consider where you most need help. If you’re struggling with marketing a small business, it’s only going to get more challenging as you scale up. Decide what aspects of your business would benefit from expertise you don’t have and look into third-party services that can help you out.</p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">📚<span> </span><strong>Resource:<span> </span></strong><a href="https://experts.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find the expertise you need with Shopify’s network of vetted experts.</a>\n</div>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>5. Automate where you can</h3>\n<p>Getting things done faster or more efficiently at scale can be made easier with tools designed to automate your workflow.</p>\n<p>These can be simple fixes, like how Matt created scripted responses to deal with a heavy influx of customer service inquiries after he appeared on<span> </span><em>Shark Tank</em>. </p>\n<p>Another example for streamlining customer service is using<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/inbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify Inbox</a><span> </span>for communicating with customers. This tool allows you to utilize live chat—which we know is<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/ecommerce-live-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fantastic way to increase conversions</a>—in a way that keeps all your conversations in one place, allows for saved responses, and gives you metrics so you can track impact.</p>\n<p>Check out<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/business-bots-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these handy bots</a><span> </span>to learn more about how to automate your business.</p>\n<h3>6. Seek new capital</h3>\n<p>Scaling costs money, and you might need to identify the<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/business-financing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right time to seek outside investment</a><span> </span>to see your plans through and keep your cash flow flowing.</p>\n<p>That timing is crucial. Capital is something you want to secure before you act on plans to grow, rather than when your business takes off and you’re left scrambling for the funds to support it.</p>\n<p>Katie knew early on that Pantee would need investment beyond that initial Kickstarter campaign.</p>\n<p>“With what our goals were, and the sort of early traction that we had seen, we knew very early on that it was not something that we could do ourselves and continue to bootstrap,” she says. “As much as it really works for some businesses, I think, for ours, it was just too out of scope for us.”</p>\n<p>Last September, Katie and Amanda started trying to raise the £200,000 ($261,000) they projected they’d need.</p>\n<p>“It\'s a difficult process. I think that we both found it to be one of the most challenging things that we’ve done,” she says.</p>\n<p>The pitching process means having a solid plan (which is why a business plan was the first step) and fielding question after question from potential investors. Expect some ups and downs—Katie said some pitches went better than others, but they did reach their goal in the end. Once they started hearing “yes,” it gave them confidence to go out and pitch more.</p>\n<p>Matt, on the other hand, made a big splash by appearing on<span> </span><em>Shark Tank</em>. The show actually approached him, and he walked away with a $300,000 deal from two of the sharks.</p>\n<p>Capital is something Shopify can help with.<span> </span><a href="https://www.shopify.ca/capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shopify Capital program</a><span> </span>is a way to secure funds that skips lengthy applications and allows you to repay using a percentage of your sales. Since 2016, Shopify Capital has made over $3 billion available to thousands of Shopify merchants, and our data shows that shops with this funding<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/capital-effect-on-business-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">average 36% higher sales</a>.</p>\n<p>We also know that women and people of color<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/close-the-funding-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have more trouble securing capital</a>, and Shopify Capital is working to close that gap. </p>\n<p> </p>\n</figure>\n</figure>\n<meta charset="utf-8">\n<figure>\n<h2 id="4">Don’t lose the big picture</h2>\n<p>There’s a reason you’ve gained the traction you already have, and you can’t lose sight of it, even as you scale.</p>\n<p>Long-time customers of Pantee are drawn to its commitment to sustainability, so they remained committed to that philosophy. To do away with any of that while scaling would defeat the purpose of trying to grow your business and impact.</p>\n<p>Katie says Pantee doesn’t see their relationship with customers as purely transactional—they’re a community. The brand’s early customers, the ones who’ve come along for the whole journey, are a pillar of support that have helped it get where it is today.</p>\n<p>“Don\'t undervalue your community,” Katie says. “Ask them for guidance to really bring them on that journey. It does really pay off.”</p>\n<p>Do right by your biggest fans and they’ll stick around as you shoot for the stars.</p>\n<p><em>Illustration by Alice Mollon</em></p>\n</figure>',

They launched in February 2021 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and have only grown since, adding new products and seeking further investment to keep up with demand.</p>\n<p>Sustainability is at the heart of Pantee and plays a role in every part of its supply chain. The brand’s challenge is staying true to that ideal while scaling up.</p>\n<h3>Matt Mundt, Founder of<span> </span><a href="https://hugsleep.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hug Sleep</a>\n</h3>\n<figure>\n<figure><img alt="Matt Mundt on Shark Tank" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Screen_Shot_2022-03-15_at_2.39.23_PM.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647369740" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Screen_Shot_2022-03-15_at_2.39.23_PM.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647369740">\n<figcaption>Photo courtesy of:<span> </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ_2gIg18Ho" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sony Pictures Television</a></figcaption>\n<p>Matt started Hug Sleep with an idea, a dream of entrepreneurship, and $2,500. The Hug Sleep is known as the blanket that hugs you back—a cozy, soothing experience based on the science of weighted blankets. The company has exploded since Matt founded it, thanks in part to<span> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/NQ_2gIg18Ho" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an appearance on<span> </span><em>Shark Tank</em></a>, where he and his wife, Angie, walked away with a $300,000 investment. </p>\n<p>Matt has had to grapple with a rapid increase in demand for what started as a solo venture he worked on after his corporate job ended for the day.</p>\n<h2 id="2">Signs you’re ready for the next stage of growth</h2>\n<p>Growth doesn’t just need the right plan, but the right timing. Growing too quickly can lead to expenses you can’t pay, employees you don’t actually need, or a supply chain that’s grown out of control. Conversely, not scaling at the right time could mean orders you can’t fulfill and tasks going unfinished.</p>\n<p>Here are a few questions to ask yourself to help you decide if it’s time to make a plan for sustainable scaling.</p>\n<h3>Are you ready for the next step in entrepreneurship?</h3>\n<p>You should only take your business to the next step if you’re truly ready for a bigger enterprise. Scaling up means your company is going to take more time, resources, and expertise that you have to be prepared to give. Scaling up is an exciting time, but you’ll need a level head to get it done in a way that’s sustainable for your business. </p>\n<p>Ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Are you ready to take on more strategic challenges?</strong><span> </span>That could mean expanding your product lines or selling globally.</li>\n<li><strong>Will you be able to dedicate more time to your business without other parts of your life suffering?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Do you have the financial resources available that you’ll need?</strong></li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do you need outside help?</strong><span> </span>You may be at a point where having someone else handle marketing or customer service would make your day easier.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do you need more employees to get the work done?</strong><span> </span>Struggling to make your business work with your current team—which might be a mighty team of one!—is a great sign that it’s time to scale up. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Are you having trouble keeping up with orders?</strong><span> </span>Having a higher volume than your business is prepared to handle means falling behind on packaging and deliveries, customer service gaps, and a whole lot of stress for you. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Are you falling behind on inventory?</strong><span> </span>If you’re constantly finding yourself sold out, with customers clamoring for restocks, it’s definitely time to scale up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, some businesses are meant to be small businesses. It’s OK if you want your side hustle to remain a side hustle. It all comes down to your personal priorities, lifestyle, and financial situation. </p>\n<h2 id="3">6 steps to scale your business</h2>\n<p>There’s no one formula for scaling a business, because every business—and founder—has unique strengths and challenges. Scaling up a clothing business, for example, is going to look different from scaling up a skin care empire. But there are some common threads to consider:</p>\n<h3>1. Make a plan for your future</h3>\n<p>If your company<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/hobby-to-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started as a hobby</a>, like in Matt’s case with Hug Sleep, you may have just been going with the flow up until this point. </p>\n<p>However, to scale sustainably, you need a business plan. It will not only help you understand your business, but it will be something you’ll need to show if you ever seek out outside investment. </p>\n<p>There are different ways to format a business plan, but a basic one should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Executive summary</li>\n<li>Company description</li>\n<li>Market analysis</li>\n<li>Management and organization</li>\n<li>Products and services</li>\n<li>Customer segmentation</li>\n<li>Marketing plan</li>\n<li>Logistics and operations plan</li>\n<li>Financial plan</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular, you’ll be creating a strategic marketing plan, with a forecast for the future outlining your plans for growth.

Already-made shirts take longer to cut and evaluate for quality, so the brand has since expanded its source materials.</p>\n<p>“We don’t just use the dead-stock T-shirts, we also use dead-stock rolls of fabric,” says Katie. “It’s the exact same grade of material, it’s just taken at a different point in the supply chain.”The fabric rolls allow for faster production but with the same commitment to sustainability. It’s even become a feature—getting their hands on a particular color lets them create a limited time collection drop that customers snap up.</p>\n<p>Pantee goods are manufactured in Bangladesh at a factory with working conditions that Katie and Amanda vetted, but going overseas might not be the right move for your supply chain.</p>\n<p>Matt scaled Hug Sleep while remaining with the same manufacturer in his home state of Wisconsin. In fact, a more local approach<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/supply-chain-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can help ease the stress</a><span> </span>that the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on global supply chains.</p>\n<p>In either case, evaluate whether your<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/13975985-how-to-find-a-manufacturer-or-supplier-for-your-product-idea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current sourcing and manufacturing processes</a><span> </span>still function well at scale. If not, you’ll need to figure out<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/dropshipping-fulfillment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next steps</a>.</p>\n<h3>3. Hire strategically</h3>\n<p>Scaling up means you may no longer be able to do everything yourself, or with whoever you’ve recruited so far to make your business work. </p>\n<p>Katie says Pantee has been running for the last year or so with just her and her sister as full-timers, supported by contractors. With a round of investment under their belts, Pantee is about to take on its first full-time employee.</p>\n<p>Specifically though, they decided the most impactful choice was to hire someone to take care of brand and community management.</p>\n<p>“Our strategy is very heavy on influencer marketing, ambassador marketing, and our partnerships, and it’s a very, very time consuming element of the business,” says Katie. Taking that workload off Katie and Amanda means more time back to focus on the core of the business.</p>\n<p>If hiring is part of your scaling strategy, you should hire where an extra person would be most effective. For Pantee, it was marketing, but for your business it could be someone to work on product or<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/hiring-for-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer service</a>, or sales. Employees are a major financial commitment, so they should be focus on an area that will bring in the most return.</p>\n<p>“We’re really excited to see what we can do sort of with an extra 40 hours a week put toward the business,” says Katie.</p>\n<h3>4. Outsource for efficiency</h3>\n<p>If it doesn’t make sense to hire your own employee, there are ways to outsource tasks to streamline your business as you scale. Matt, for example, doesn’t have any full-time employees. Instead, he uses an agency to handle all his marketing because he realized it was something a third-party would be better at.</p>\n<p>“My background is in mechanical engineering,” he says. “I’m a numbers guy and a data guy. I thought there’s no challenge that I can’t get over.” So Matt tried to teach himself how to launch ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Google.</p>\n<p>“I tried, and it didn’t work all that well.”</p>\n<figure><img alt="A model wrapped in a Hug Sleep blanket" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/hugsleep.jpg?v=1647034861" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/hugsleep.jpg?v=1647034861">\n<figcaption>Photo courtesy of:<span> </span><a href="https://hugsleep.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hug Sleep</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>By talking to agencies, Matt finally realized that they could create a more sophisticated campaign than he could, so he outsourced.</p>\n<p>He also hit a wall on<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/fulfillment-analytics-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order fulfillment</a>. He used to pack all the orders himself and drop them off at the post office on his lunch breaks. But that doesn’t work at scale. He now uses the<span> </span><a href="https://www.shopify.com/fulfillment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify Fulfillment Network</a><span> </span>to do the heavy lifting.</p>\n<p>Whether hiring an agency or an employee, you should consider where you most need help. If you’re struggling with marketing a small business, it’s only going to get more challenging as you scale up. Decide what aspects of your business would benefit from expertise you don’t have and look into third-party services that can help you out.</p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">📚<span> </span><strong>Resource:<span> </span></strong><a href="https://experts.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find the expertise you need with Shopify’s network of vetted experts.</a>\n</div>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>5. Automate where you can</h3>\n<p>Getting things done faster or more efficiently at scale can be made easier with tools designed to automate your workflow.</p>\n<p>These can be simple fixes, like how Matt created scripted responses to deal with a heavy influx of customer service inquiries after he appeared on<span> </span><em>Shark Tank</em>. </p>\n<p>Another example for streamlining customer service is using<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/inbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify Inbox</a><span> </span>for communicating with customers. This tool allows you to utilize live chat—which we know is<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/ecommerce-live-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fantastic way to increase conversions</a>—in a way that keeps all your conversations in one place, allows for saved responses, and gives you metrics so you can track impact.</p>\n<p>Check out<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/business-bots-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these handy bots</a><span> </span>to learn more about how to automate your business.</p>\n<h3>6. Seek new capital</h3>\n<p>Scaling costs money, and you might need to identify the<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/business-financing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right time to seek outside investment</a><span> </span>to see your plans through and keep your cash flow flowing.</p>\n<p>That timing is crucial. Capital is something you want to secure before you act on plans to grow, rather than when your business takes off and you’re left scrambling for the funds to support it.</p>\n<p>Katie knew early on that Pantee would need investment beyond that initial Kickstarter campaign.</p>\n<p>“With what our goals were, and the sort of early traction that we had seen, we knew very early on that it was not something that we could do ourselves and continue to bootstrap,” she says. “As much as it really works for some businesses, I think, for ours, it was just too out of scope for us.”</p>\n<p>Last September, Katie and Amanda started trying to raise the £200,000 ($261,000) they projected they’d need.</p>\n<p>“It\'s a difficult process. I think that we both found it to be one of the most challenging things that we’ve done,” she says.</p>\n<p>The pitching process means having a solid plan (which is why a business plan was the first step) and fielding question after question from potential investors. Expect some ups and downs—Katie said some pitches went better than others, but they did reach their goal in the end. Once they started hearing “yes,” it gave them confidence to go out and pitch more.</p>\n<p>Matt, on the other hand, made a big splash by appearing on<span> </span><em>Shark Tank</em>. The show actually approached him, and he walked away with a $300,000 deal from two of the sharks.</p>\n<p>Capital is something Shopify can help with.<span> </span><a href="https://www.shopify.ca/capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shopify Capital program</a><span> </span>is a way to secure funds that skips lengthy applications and allows you to repay using a percentage of your sales. Since 2016, Shopify Capital has made over $3 billion available to thousands of Shopify merchants, and our data shows that shops with this funding<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/capital-effect-on-business-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">average 36% higher sales</a>.</p>\n<p>We also know that women and people of color<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/close-the-funding-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have more trouble securing capital</a>, and Shopify Capital is working to close that gap. </p>\n<p> </p>\n</figure>\n</figure>\n<meta charset="utf-8">\n<figure>\n<h2 id="4">Don’t lose the big picture</h2>\n<p>There’s a reason you’ve gained the traction you already have, and you can’t lose sight of it, even as you scale.</p>\n<p>Long-time customers of Pantee are drawn to its commitment to sustainability, so they remained committed to that philosophy. To do away with any of that while scaling would defeat the purpose of trying to grow your business and impact.</p>\n<p>Katie says Pantee doesn’t see their relationship with customers as purely transactional—they’re a community. The brand’s early customers, the ones who’ve come along for the whole journey, are a pillar of support that have helped it get where it is today.</p>\n<p>“Don\'t undervalue your community,” Katie says. “Ask them for guidance to really bring them on that journey. It does really pay off.”</p>\n<p>Do right by your biggest fans and they’ll stick around as you shoot for the stars.</p>\n<p><em>Illustration by Alice Mollon</em></p>\n</figure>',

Back then, she was not really informed about, breastfeeding topics on maternity as a young mom, I don't know with her first son, but she did not breastfeed for very long or something. Then she got her second kid, Maali, which was completely different. She breastfed for 18 months And it worked perfectly well. And so that's why for her third one, she knew she wanted to breastfeed even before giving birth. When she was eight months pregnant, she had, I think it's called appendicitis. So she had to get operated on while still pregnant. I think she got like three or four operations. She stayed in the hospital for like two months after giving birth and stuff like that. And she had a lot of morphine treatments, she couldn't breastfeed in the hospital. But she really wanted to, so when she went back home after a month, she stayed all weekend with Lou, it's the name of her last born trying to breastfeed. And she ended up managing to breastfeed. </p>\n<p>Breastfeeding clothing always existed, the concept exists for like 50 years or something. She was just not a client of breastfeeding clothing. She did not recognize herself, so what she was doing, she was wearing normal clothes. And just lifting a T-shirt to breastfeed. She had a lot of bandages and scars. And so lifting the T-shirt became an issue. And that's how, with, a T-shirt of Raf, her boyfriend’s, it was an oversized T-shirt, she made two cuts and she realized it was actually pretty practical, that you did not have to lift the T-shirt And that's how she really imagined the first concept. It was to fill the needs of what she thought was a couple of moms like her wanting to stay a bit stylish while having something practical to breastfeed with.</p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>So how did you get involved with the business? And how did you start working with your sister?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>That was purely random. When we tell the story sounds like a lot of crap, but that's how it happened. We launched Tajinebane, I think, on the eighth of August, I don't know, we were supposed to spend a couple of days. I was at the time, in an internship in Paris, my last internship to finish my studies. </p>\n<p>And then even the day when she launched it, we were actually at the beach with my girlfriend, Raphael her boyfriend, and then my sister was launching Tajine Banane. she thought it would be a fail, felt like her product was not good enough. I think a lot of entrepreneurs have this moment when they launched the thing, they don't even believe in their own stuff anymore. She launched it. We had our first order something 10 minutes after the launch. Nobody knew us, especially we really like started from nowhere. On Instagram, I think we reached 2000 followers. We were 200 just before the launch or something. I don't know what happened launch date, but we got reposted by the right person. And then from then more people reposted. </p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Ali Cavaillé in a green Tajinebanane T-shirt along with her brother Marvin in their retail store celebrating their third business anniversary. \" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/TJB_12-09-21-202_2.jpg?v=1647247872\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/TJB_12-09-21-202_2.jpg?v=1647247872\">\n<figcaption>Sibling Ali and Marvin Cavaillé built Tajinebanane as an empowering community by offering stylish and functional clothing for breastfeeding. <em>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>We got like good visibility, not a huge one, but a good one. And we had the first day like something like five, six orders. My sister never thought of Tajinebane as a business, they did not even have a laptop at the time, they did not make any<span> </span><a href=\"https://en.shopify.hk/blog/business-plan\">business plan</a>, even if you don't really need to make a business plan. Even the price of a T-shirt, she didn't calculate it because it sounded good. Like 39 was a good price, like a good psychological price. It's not too much, it's under 40, but she did not even calculate all the cost of shipping and stuff like that. My sister, I still remember her 24 hours after the launch, she was crying. She was like, \"Yeah, I won't be able to do it.\" </p>\n<p>I'm not saying like I saved the day or something, but I had a little bit of business knowledge. In the first 24 hours we haven't slept, we're starting to start a business within 24 hours kind of, so just an Excel sheet trying to find the cost. She didn't even know how much the T-shirt cost us, I had to add invoices to the suppliers and everything. And from this moment, we never left. But we did invest ourselves 100% from day one.</p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>So you are all self-funded, no external investments?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>Exactly, yeah. We do not really have the money back then, What really helped is my dad helped us with the first order of T-shirts. I think it was a couple of grand, it was not even a big investment. Like I think anybody nowadays can make an investment of $2,000, or euros in their own business, in their own ideas. But we did not even have those 2000 back then. So my dad helped with the first order. And then from this moment, we sold 100 T-shirts, we decided to pull them out of stock because we were not really happy with the first product. We launched it, we did not find it very practical, it changed a lot since. And then we did some pre-orders, so it's not really crowdfunding. But you were buying basically your product, you were not buying a concept, buying an idea, you were buying your T-shirt, and you just had to wait 10 to 12 weeks to receive it. So we manage like that to pass the order, and no financing or production upfront, as a lot of people are doing today. We did not invent anything or something, so we didn't really do crowdfunding. But more or less, we started that, I think a couple, three first-order were like that. We always took something like 10, 20% more in quantities in case.</p>\n<h2><strong>Identifying the first roles you should hire to grow and scale</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>And now you have a physical retail space and a bigger team. Tell us more about expanding and scaling Tajinebanane. </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>Our first recruitment was at the end of 2019, I think it was for customer service. Because at some point, we realized nobody could be as applied as we were in this project because it's your own project, you give everything you have. </p>\n<p>The first thing we had to do to start growing and scaling was to outsource logistics. In ecommerce, I think is the first thing you should do. You should never think twice about outsourcing logistics because the first eight months we were packing ourselves, we were in the garage of my sister’s. And we literally spend from eight in the morning and we had to be at the post office by four in the afternoon because at four that’s when they stop shipping the same day. So from eight to four, we were in the garage packing order, but in this time you do nothing that will add value to your company. There’s absolutely no added value. It's nice because you're careful in the shipping, you can put little notes so it's better for the customer but you put way too much effort.</p>\n<p>From four in the afternoon, we were done with the orders, and then we had to answer emails, we had to do Instagram, we have to think of other products, think of marketing strategies. In the old days, we worked from eight in the morning to midnight every day. And we even had to stop a marketing strategy because we knew we would be behind if we got more orders. And then we met a person who knew someone who was an expert in fulfillment, logistics.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A mom wearing a Tajinebanane sweater while breastfeeding her baby. \" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/TAJINE_BANANE_17471_2.jpg?v=1647252386\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/TAJINE_BANANE_17471_2.jpg?v=1647252386\">\n<figcaption>Tajinebanane’s team only expanded after a year of operations by hiring a logistics specialist to help them scale. <em>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It was a bit hard in the beginning because you had your T-shirts, your stocks, and have to get rid of them and move to a new facility. But from this moment, logistics was not an issue anymore. Then at the same point in time, it was more me taking care of emails, for example. At a point when I was spending six hours answering emails per day, I realized it's not needed that every email to be answered by me. So we did outsource. I think we're really careful in the way we manage our business. I'm not saying it's the best way to do it, we call it like in French which translates to we prefer “putting yourself underwater” and work a lot. Until the moment where really the added value was not there anymore. And then we did find someone to help. So that was 2019. And then 2020 is like when we really build the team. And today with 24 employees, and my sister and me.</p>\n<h2><strong>Fostering a community before selling a single product </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>That's quite a lot of growth. Another big part of it is how Tajinebanane approaches storytelling. Can you let us know what got the first set of customers aware of your products and actually be a paying customer?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>The first thing you have to know is my sister worked in personal support in a hospital. She never studied marketing. She never read books about marketing. She was just very comfortable. She had a MySpace. It was always great. When Facebook arrived, she had a Facebook, it was great, great pictures. Instagram came, she had a great Instagram. I don't think it's something you can learn, how to use social media. I learned marketing in school but I will never be able to be close enough to the talent of my sister. Even if someone's doing a master's in communication, my sister is still going to be better. Not to say my sister is the best.</p>\n<p>So the launch of the company was in August. She started Instagram in April or May. And when she started to do it, it was just content, like talking about maternity, talking about breastfeeding, her story too. We never sold a product, that's the thing you have to remember. We never sell a product except on the launch day where we're going to say like how good this new T-shirt is, but afterward, it's more about content. </p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A model with tattoos wearing a white Tajinebanane T-shirt with a milk carton design.\" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/CLARA_SEGUI_TAJINE_BANANE_V2-29_2.jpg?v=1647252501\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/CLARA_SEGUI_TAJINE_BANANE_V2-29_2.jpg?v=1647252501\">\n<figcaption> By sharing her story with breastfeeding, Ali created content that engaged with her community and it allowed Tajinebanane to thrive.  <em><span> </span>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>What we realized is brands never have big engagement on Instagram. People want to be interested and learn. So that's how I think we managed to keep followers happy, or interested at least. And so, she built this little community but since then we never changed our strategy. you can't have a strategy on communication, I'd say you have guidelines, you have values, and our guideline values haven't changed since the beginning. We're not selling a product, we're selling the concept. We're selling something to help moms in their challenges every day, But that's why it's hard to present Tajinebane as a breastfeeding clothing company. No, it's not just that, it's all this stuff around it.</p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:</strong><span> </span>And did you reach a point where you wanted to invest in marketing, maybe put money behind ads and start having a marketing budget. Did you ever transition into that way of operating?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>Not really, that's the other thing. Our advertising budget is close to zero, we started Google Ads a couple of months ago we did just one campaign in 2019. We spend maybe €50 on Instagram. It's still possible to have natural growth, natural content. And it's just you have to say interesting things. I think you have to touch subjects. You have to find the right influencer to work with.</p>\n<p>I think moms don't want to change the dress code just because they gave birth. But if we would have made a market study, we would have realized probably that it's not an interesting market for us, because if you were a client of breastfeeding clothing you're going to play like it's a bit prettier maybe, it's a bit more practical, but on the other hand, you're not going get all the market of breastfeeding clothing mom, just because you're prettier and more practical. Who we did manage to touch are all the moms, who did not buy breastfeeding clothing, because they do not recognize themselves in them, and they do not find the need for it. And that's where most of our customers are.</p>\n<h2><strong>Nurturing a long-term relationship with customers </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:</strong><span> </span>For parents that move past the stage of breastfeeding, how do you keep that relationship going as they move through different parts of their life?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>I think our first kid clothing was maybe a year after our launch. The thing we realize first is we thought too then the moms are breastfeeding a couple of months, and then it stops. And so, what are you gonna do? You're going to have to renew always your customer base and find new customers. What we realized was not that... You have as many, breastfeeding journeys as mothers basically, What we realized is even if a mom did stop breastfeeding, she kept wearing our clothes, because it was some kind of souvenir. We're not saying that breastfeeding is better than getting the bottle, it was never a topic. But what we realized is like when mom is breastfeeding, they're having a moment with their child which is very, very powerful. And so basically, you're touching a moment which is really important, a lot of emotions, hormones everything. So it's an emotional moment. </p>\n<p>A lot of our clients are not even breastfeeding. They just like the concept, the brands. They support the brands. We also have moms that ordered in 2018, stop breastfeeding 2019 by the second kid or third kid but as long as they bought it the first time they know the brands, they keep following us. That's again, the most important thing about content. Because those people, if they're not clients anymore, you still have to keep them interested. They don't care about your new product because they don't need it anymore. But we managed to keep them because we talked about subjects which are interesting to them, even if they don't breastfeed anymore, you have so many topics around maternity, you can talk for hours about it. And so basically these people we keep, and then when they get pregnant again, I'm telling you, sometimes we are first to know before their husband, they send us a picture of their pregnancy test saying like, \"Oh, I'm going to be able to reorder soon.\"</p>\n<p>Then there’s kids' Clothing too. So we realized when we started making kids' clothing, it didn't really work. But after a year or after 18 months, it started working because we realized it's the same, you start breastfeeding, you prefer buying stuff for yourself. Because when you know someone was going to give birth, you're always going to buy your present for the kid. Like a little teddy bear for the kid, or clothes for the kid. But nobody really thinks about the mom. Like even if it's still a really huge moment for her too. So they want to make themselves happy we realized you start by buying stuff for yourself, and then at some point after a year of breastfeeding, either you stop or either you start buying stuff for your kid too. I'd say now, kids, we're not on the same volume as breastfeeding. But it's a balance. <img alt=\"&lt;p&gt;What we realized is brands never have big engagement on Instagram. People want to be interested and learn. So that's how I think we managed to keep followers happy, or interested at least. And so, she built this little community but since then we never changed our strategy. you can't have a strategy on communication, I'd say you have guidelines, you have values, and our guideline values haven't changed since the beginning. We're not selling a product, we're selling the concept. We're selling something to help moms in their challenges every day, But that's why it's hard to present Tajinebane as a breastfeeding clothing company. No, it's not just that, it's all this stuff around it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shuang:&lt;/strong&gt; And did you reach a point where you wanted to invest in marketing, maybe put money behind ads and start having a marketing budget. Did you ever transition into that way of operating?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marvin: &lt;/strong&gt;Not really, that's the other thing. Our advertising budget is close to zero, we started Google Ads a couple of months ago we did just one campaign in 2019. We spend maybe &amp;euro;50 on Instagram. It's still possible to have natural growth, natural content. And it's just you have to say interesting things. I think you have to touch subjects. You have to find the right influencer to work with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think moms don't want to change the dress code just because they gave birth. But if we would have made a market study, we would have realized probably that it's not an interesting market for us, because if you were a client of breastfeeding clothing you're going to play like it's a bit prettier maybe, it's a bit more practical, but on the other hand, you're not going get all the market of breastfeeding clothing mom, just because you're prettier and more practical. Who we did manage to touch are all the moms, who did not buy breastfeeding clothing, because they do not recognize themselves in them, and they do not find the need for it. And that's where most of our customers are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nurturing a long-term relationship with customers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shuang:&lt;/strong&gt; For parents that move past the stage of breastfeeding, how do you keep that relationship going as they move through different parts of their life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marvin: &lt;/strong&gt;I think our first kid clothing was maybe a year after our launch. The thing we realize first is we thought too then the moms are breastfeeding a couple of months, and then it stops. And so, what are you gonna do? You're going to have to renew always your customer base and find new customers. What we realized was not that... You have as many, breastfeeding journeys as mothers basically, What we realized is even if a mom did stop breastfeeding, she kept wearing our clothes, because it was some kind of souvenir. We're not saying that breastfeeding is better than getting the bottle, it was never a topic. But what we realized is like when mom is breastfeeding, they're having a moment with their child which is very, very powerful. And so basically, you're touching a moment which is really important, a lot of emotions, hormones everything. So it's an emotional moment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of our clients are not even breastfeeding. They just like the concept, the brands. They support the brands. We also have moms that ordered in 2018, stop breastfeeding 2019 by the second kid or third kid but as long as they bought it the first time they know the brands, they keep following us.

It was two micro-influencer but it was huge for us at the time. And talking about subjects around maternity education and stuff like that. And so they really got interested in the concept. One of them was breastfeeding, she ordered, she liked it, she reposted. And from this moment, my sister spends almost all her day on Instagram. So she was following interesting people on topics. And we started by gifting them. So you send a couple of T-shirts, you send nice notes. And it started like that. And they like the brands, they like the concept, so they always reshare without any proper financial arrangements. But on the other hand, when we gift someone, we never tell them, \"Oh, you have to post, or you have to make a story.\" That's the thing. You know, if you send a gift then it's a gift. So if she (the receiver) doesn't want to talk about it, then she doesn't talk about it. And I think it's this relationship we have with them, it's not a contract. It's more like, “Here you go, we want to make you happy, to please you, now you do whatever you want with it.” And often they repost because they accept the gesture. And they like the brand. They like the product. It's nice to talk about branding with values, or so, I'd say. We never really had sponsor relationships.</p>\n<p>And even if the influencers stop breastfeeding, we still give them other stuff. I mean, we have a relationship, we work with some influencers, we worked since 2018. It's not even working. I mean, it's a relationship. My sister became friends with some of them. So they talked about all the topics and stuff. It was never a financial like relationship or contract, or like, I give you that, you have to give me that in return. If I don't have that many followers, I'm not gonna work with you anymore. It was never like that. And then after you do, of course, giveaways with other brands, that was always something we did from the beginning. And not all the brands wanted to give away with us, so they come naturally too. </p>\n<h2><strong>Running a business with romantic and familial ties </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:</strong><span> </span>How has the relationship with your sister developed over the years?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>I think we are really lucky to be a family business because the important thing with your associates is to be able to tell each other stuff. I find it easier to tell my sister stuff like a friend, It's easier to fight with your sister, and you always fought before, maybe more than to fight with a friend. So already I think we were very straight with each other from the beginning. On a personal level, I think you don't have a notion as an entrepreneur of personal and professional anymore. Like if I’m honest I don't really have this dimension because in three years we only talk about Tajinebane, we don't have really other topics. Of course, we manage to talk about something else from time to time but Tajinebanane is still the main topic coming back to the table. So I think we grew closer We were not neighbors. I mean, I was living in Paris, she was in La Rochelle We were not seeing each other very often. And now, we see each other every day I think I'd say we grew closer, and I think she would say the same thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:</strong><span> </span>What advice do you have for family members who want to run a business together? </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>I don't know. we're siblings and on top of that, both our partners are associated with it. And I always heard people saying I could never work with my boyfriend or my girlfriend. It's very hard and stuff. And I don't know, it never really happened to us somehow. I think, of course, if you don't have a great relationship with your siblings, maybe it's not going to work out. When we were young, we were always together as young kids. We were always doing stuff together. We had a really strong relationship younger, then after we grew a bit apart, but that's a different journey too. And then we came back together with Tajinebane. </p>\n<p>You still have to have a good basis and to split the roles, to split the responsibilities. For example, my sister, I'm never going to make a decision on her part, like she's going to never make a decision on mine. Because we are both CEOs of the company, I have more of the process, the back office part. She has more of our brand and our direction. She's the brand, I'm the company. That's how we do it. We both trust each other on each of our parts. She's never going to tell me like, \"Hey, what did you do now?\" Or something like that. I'm never going to tell her like, \"Why did you do that?\" We leave each other in peace.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The store of Tajinebanane in Bordeaux, France. Complete with the latest apparel and accessories on its shelves. \" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/TB_S_1.jpg?v=1647252731\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/TB_S_1.jpg?v=1647252731\">\n<figcaption>Tajinebanane is a family affair where Marvin and Ali’s partners are also working on the business.<em><span> </span>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>Then there’s also the partner aspect, both of your partners are also in the company. Tell us more about having your respective life partners working together. </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>Christina, my partner, I work still a lot with her on different aspects of our missions. You still have your moments where you're on your own. And so, I think everybody has their own responsibility. For example, Christina, my partner, I could be technically her boss. I'm never going to tell her. She's more like the boss of me kind of, you know what I mean? So nobody is the boss, and anybody understands my sister is not the boss of Rafael, I'm not the boss of Christina. It's like in real life, you have to respect your partner. No one is better than the other. And at work, it's the same. So I think it's great. We spend a lot of time together. And I think the other thing where it's great to be with your partner, is because I think during the first year of starting the business if she was not in Tajinebane, she would've left me. You work extra hard 24/7, you're never there. And who's best to understand that if she's living in it herself. </p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>And what are their respective roles?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>So Christina, she's German. She's more on international development. focusing on Germany because now we have someone an English speaker as well for English speaking countries. It's like a lot of administrative aspects, and we do it together. And Rafael was going to be in the boutique, And he helps my sister on Instagram. So that's why Christina never really works with my sister, and I don't really work with Raf. And so basically, Raf helps my sister to answer messages on Instagram. So even today, Instagram, if you text on Instagram, the one that's going to answer you is gonna be my sister or her boyfriend. Even Rafael became friends with some of her clients, they talk about all the topics and stuff like that. It was always like that, like a family. Even our customers recognize themself as a big family. And we were always really, very close with our customers. And we don't even see them as customers. </p>\n<h2><strong>Recalibrating after a growth “crisis”</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>Tell us more about the retail store and how it acts as a community hub. </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>Most of our customers spend an hour in the shop, and any other shops in the world would be with the interest of kicking the customer out as quickly as possible. For us, it's the other way around. Even if a customer spends three hours and does not buy anything at the end, it's okay too. You have to be able to feel like this person had a good moment. For the drinks, we offer them even if you don't order. If you want a coffee, we're not gonna make you pay for it. We believe in don't treat your customer like you will not like to be treated by a company kind of.</p>\n<p>That was always the spirit, and for the loyalty program, it was the same. We built a loyalty program. We imagined this loyalty program, we did not calculate it. For example, if given that I'm gonna have that in return, and it's gonna cost me that and stuff. We just made it how we would've liked to have a loyalty program. So you see our loyalty program today nobody's doing that. We offer sometimes €40 as a voucher, no company is doing that. And it was more like to be nice, to reward actually the clients who spend like thousands, hundreds of thousands of euros in our shop.</p>\n<p>Of course, we are a business. So you have to think about profits, If you're not profitable, you're not going to work out in any case. So there's always those two dimensions, and you have to keep at least the balance may never put the business first. </p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A model wears a sweatshirt from Tajinebanane against a blue sky background.\" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/IMG_0078_2.jpg?v=1647252850\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/IMG_0078_2.jpg?v=1647252850\">\n<figcaption>For Tajinebanane the hardest part of growing quickly is managing the large expenses and cashflows when sales fluctuated.<em><span> </span>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>Was it ever scary to have all four of your livelihood tied to the business? </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>We don't really think about it. It's maybe the growth of the company is how the thing turns out, but since the beginning somehow, all the signals are green, The first difficulties we had was this year. This year was the worst, I like to call it a growth crisis. It's hard to run a business that's not working. But it's even harder to run a business that's working crazy. Or maybe not harder, but more dangerous. Because the problem is your revenue is growing, expenses are growing the same way. And at some point when you start to make less revenue, the expenses don't decrease anymore. That's the problem with expenses. I think from 2020 we made like 400% growth or something like over the year, 300 or 400%, I can't remember exactly. And this year we're at 50%.</p>\n<p>Which is still great, most company will be really happy for growth like that. But going from 300% to 50% growth, in your plans, it was not the same, because we did not plan on 300 again this year, but we did plan stocks in a way that would have a big growth compared to last year actually. It was still growing but not as big as expected. </p>\n<p>If you have way too much stock you spend a lot of money on expenses in general. And so it was a transitional year but it's a good thing too, because at least last year, we have this year to base ourselves on because that's the hard thing with a growing company. When you grow too quickly, you can't base yourself. And that's very important to do planning to know how many units you produce, for example. And I think next year is going to be the easy one, and it's going to be like the one where basically I'm comfortable enough to say how much revenue I'm gonna make next year. </p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong> What were some things you did to gain financial clarity and to have a better grasp on the business again? </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>I was very invested in Tajinebane, I way too much into figures, I was way too involved personally and psychologically speaking into the company. The first thing that was important to do is to take a step backward on your own business, You have to take a step backward to really understand what's wrong today, what's not working as well as last year?</p>\n<p>And so that was the hardest thing to do for me this year, at least. Because when you every day into the account, every day into the sales, every day into the stock. a few years ago we had no money, now I'm gonna pay maybe within one day $100,000. I'm gonna make the transfer to suppliers. Like I'm buying a house every month.</p>\n<p>And second, you have to know what's not working today. It's normal to be less profitable as much as you grow because expenses are static sometimes. And to take one step at a time, and to be optimistic. </p>\n<h2><strong>The journey of finding the right ecommerce solution and plans for an impactful future</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>What are some tools, apps that really helped you build, and are there any favorites that you can share?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>We're on Shopify since February 2020, We were before on WooCommerce. we started on Wix. So all the steps, we had to change the solution. Wix, the problem was with the logistics, so we could not interface with our logistics software. So we went on WooCommerce, but WooCommerce was full of bugs. but for us, it was not possible. So when we had a lot of traffic on the website, for example, that people could not order or spend sometimes an hour to order because it was too many people. The website was lagging, the server was lagging. It was someone from Shopify who knew the brand or something like that, and they contacted us because we were starting to become famous for how our website was lagging, people knew. And so with Shopify partner presented us with an agency in Paris, it was really good. We built our first website. And since we never lag or something, you can do anything you want.</p>\n<p>The first app we took I think we had one app, which is called Intercom. I don't know if you know, it's customer service, So you have a chat on their website, and customers can reach you through this chatbox. We have also another solution and we love it, it's Klaviyo. So we're fully integrated, so that's great too. And we use Klaviyo, it's a CRM solution. we use it for our main loyalty program stuff because they have something we call flows, automated emails. So basically, I know it's your birthday, you receive an email with a code But Klaviyo is great to segment, it's very user-friendly. I think Shopify understood everything, and if you don't do the switch today, you might get in trouble at some point because, I don't know, now every time we think about a new solution, we think about how it's integrated into Shopify, we have also Fitle, I don't know if you know, it's a sizing tool, recommendation tool.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\" An array of clothing on racks within the Tajinebanane retail store.\" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnameda_1.jpg?v=1647252943\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnameda_1.jpg?v=1647252943\">\n<figcaption>Ali and Marvine placed an emphasis on building a charity aspect into Tajinebanane by offer clothing to the less fortunate and supporting various organizations.<em><span> </span>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>Amazing. And then looking forward, are there any plans or news that you can share that you want to highlight?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>The first plan would be to keep things the way they are. As I told you before, profits come after keeping the spirit. We have an amazing team, we found employees which are really invested, they love the message, they love the company. They probably do feel like they are invested in us today. And to keep the company like that, to keep the employees like that. And after more business speaking, we already are like really big in France, We want to expand a bit abroad too.<br>Europe is a great market for us. We're not focusing too much on the U.S. yet. We started it, but it's pretty particular in the U.S. when you're a European business. I mean, it's a lot of investment, we're focusing on Europe now. And maybe we are planning on opening a new boutique in Paris, this one's working well. So maybe extend the concept too. also really important like a part of the company, which is in the social charity area. So since we started, basically, we always made partnerships with associations. So we, for example, created something that did exist before, but we adapted it to our company. But the concept of... In France, I don't know if it's the same in the U.S., but for example, you go to a bar and pay yourself for a coffee and you can leave to the barman like one extra euro. And if less fortunate people want to have a coffee, basically it's this concept of you go the bar and it's five extra euro there, so here, you can have your coffee or something like that. So we did put the exact same concept on the website, so people can leave a euro, €2, €5, €10, whatever. And we turn all this money into... Like we give clothes at the same time. So for example, if you buy a T-shirt, let's say €18, we got €18, but we give €18. We're not charging like 44, as it's really what we paid, covered by the donation of clients. And we do that... It's always one going out. Every three months we change the association. After we do fundraising. And my sister has always wanted, this her plan since she started Tajinebane's to like build the Tajinebane foundation. she's invited to the Ministry for the rights of women to breastfeed. She's becoming a bit of a public figure. It's funny to say it like that, but she has a plan of her own too in this area. So we take it one step at a time, It's no big plans for the future because we realized that when you make big plans, it anyway never happens. That's the thing. </p>",

          "<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><span>Every breastfeeding journey is unique. Inspired by her own journey, and frustrated by the lack of stylish, functional clothing options for breastfeeding moms, Ali </span><span>Cavaillé and</span><span> her brother Marvin built Tajinebanane from a borrowed laptop and their garage. Today Tajinebanane is changing the way society views breastfeeding through a successful retail shop and thriving online community. In this episode of Shopify Masters, Marvin shares with us the key areas for outsourcing, content that built an engaging community, and how Tajinebanae is incorporating social impact into its operations. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Shopify_Masters_Transcript_-_Tajinebanane.rtfd.zip?v=1647253666\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>For the full transcript of this episode, click here.</strong></a></p>\n<iframe height=\"200px\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" src=\"https://player.simplecast.com/489e3330-dbb3-4ce1-9f03-e27b5ee1b921?dark=true\"></iframe><span></span>\n<div><strong>Don't miss an episode!

Back then, she was not really informed about, breastfeeding topics on maternity as a young mom, I don't know with her first son, but she did not breastfeed for very long or something. Then she got her second kid, Maali, which was completely different. She breastfed for 18 months And it worked perfectly well. And so that's why for her third one, she knew she wanted to breastfeed even before giving birth. When she was eight months pregnant, she had, I think it's called appendicitis. So she had to get operated on while still pregnant. I think she got like three or four operations. She stayed in the hospital for like two months after giving birth and stuff like that. And she had a lot of morphine treatments, she couldn't breastfeed in the hospital. But she really wanted to, so when she went back home after a month, she stayed all weekend with Lou, it's the name of her last born trying to breastfeed. And she ended up managing to breastfeed. </p>\n<p>Breastfeeding clothing always existed, the concept exists for like 50 years or something. She was just not a client of breastfeeding clothing. She did not recognize herself, so what she was doing, she was wearing normal clothes. And just lifting a T-shirt to breastfeed. She had a lot of bandages and scars. And so lifting the T-shirt became an issue. And that's how, with, a T-shirt of Raf, her boyfriend’s, it was an oversized T-shirt, she made two cuts and she realized it was actually pretty practical, that you did not have to lift the T-shirt And that's how she really imagined the first concept. It was to fill the needs of what she thought was a couple of moms like her wanting to stay a bit stylish while having something practical to breastfeed with.</p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>So how did you get involved with the business? And how did you start working with your sister?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>That was purely random. When we tell the story sounds like a lot of crap, but that's how it happened. We launched Tajinebane, I think, on the eighth of August, I don't know, we were supposed to spend a couple of days. I was at the time, in an internship in Paris, my last internship to finish my studies. </p>\n<p>And then even the day when she launched it, we were actually at the beach with my girlfriend, Raphael her boyfriend, and then my sister was launching Tajine Banane. she thought it would be a fail, felt like her product was not good enough. I think a lot of entrepreneurs have this moment when they launched the thing, they don't even believe in their own stuff anymore. She launched it. We had our first order something 10 minutes after the launch. Nobody knew us, especially we really like started from nowhere. On Instagram, I think we reached 2000 followers. We were 200 just before the launch or something. I don't know what happened launch date, but we got reposted by the right person. And then from then more people reposted. </p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Ali Cavaillé in a green Tajinebanane T-shirt along with her brother Marvin in their retail store celebrating their third business anniversary. \" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/TJB_12-09-21-202_2.jpg?v=1647247872\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/TJB_12-09-21-202_2.jpg?v=1647247872\">\n<figcaption>Sibling Ali and Marvin Cavaillé built Tajinebanane as an empowering community by offering stylish and functional clothing for breastfeeding. <em>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>We got like good visibility, not a huge one, but a good one. And we had the first day like something like five, six orders. My sister never thought of Tajinebane as a business, they did not even have a laptop at the time, they did not make any<span> </span><a href=\"https://en.shopify.hk/blog/business-plan\">business plan</a>, even if you don't really need to make a business plan. Even the price of a T-shirt, she didn't calculate it because it sounded good. Like 39 was a good price, like a good psychological price. It's not too much, it's under 40, but she did not even calculate all the cost of shipping and stuff like that. My sister, I still remember her 24 hours after the launch, she was crying. She was like, \"Yeah, I won't be able to do it.\" </p>\n<p>I'm not saying like I saved the day or something, but I had a little bit of business knowledge. In the first 24 hours we haven't slept, we're starting to start a business within 24 hours kind of, so just an Excel sheet trying to find the cost. She didn't even know how much the T-shirt cost us, I had to add invoices to the suppliers and everything. And from this moment, we never left. But we did invest ourselves 100% from day one.</p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>So you are all self-funded, no external investments?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>Exactly, yeah. We do not really have the money back then, What really helped is my dad helped us with the first order of T-shirts. I think it was a couple of grand, it was not even a big investment. Like I think anybody nowadays can make an investment of $2,000, or euros in their own business, in their own ideas. But we did not even have those 2000 back then. So my dad helped with the first order. And then from this moment, we sold 100 T-shirts, we decided to pull them out of stock because we were not really happy with the first product. We launched it, we did not find it very practical, it changed a lot since. And then we did some pre-orders, so it's not really crowdfunding. But you were buying basically your product, you were not buying a concept, buying an idea, you were buying your T-shirt, and you just had to wait 10 to 12 weeks to receive it. So we manage like that to pass the order, and no financing or production upfront, as a lot of people are doing today. We did not invent anything or something, so we didn't really do crowdfunding. But more or less, we started that, I think a couple, three first-order were like that. We always took something like 10, 20% more in quantities in case.</p>\n<h2><strong>Identifying the first roles you should hire to grow and scale</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>And now you have a physical retail space and a bigger team. Tell us more about expanding and scaling Tajinebanane. </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>Our first recruitment was at the end of 2019, I think it was for customer service. Because at some point, we realized nobody could be as applied as we were in this project because it's your own project, you give everything you have. </p>\n<p>The first thing we had to do to start growing and scaling was to outsource logistics. In ecommerce, I think is the first thing you should do. You should never think twice about outsourcing logistics because the first eight months we were packing ourselves, we were in the garage of my sister’s. And we literally spend from eight in the morning and we had to be at the post office by four in the afternoon because at four that’s when they stop shipping the same day. So from eight to four, we were in the garage packing order, but in this time you do nothing that will add value to your company. There’s absolutely no added value. It's nice because you're careful in the shipping, you can put little notes so it's better for the customer but you put way too much effort.</p>\n<p>From four in the afternoon, we were done with the orders, and then we had to answer emails, we had to do Instagram, we have to think of other products, think of marketing strategies. In the old days, we worked from eight in the morning to midnight every day. And we even had to stop a marketing strategy because we knew we would be behind if we got more orders. And then we met a person who knew someone who was an expert in fulfillment, logistics.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A mom wearing a Tajinebanane sweater while breastfeeding her baby. \" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/TAJINE_BANANE_17471_2.jpg?v=1647252386\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/TAJINE_BANANE_17471_2.jpg?v=1647252386\">\n<figcaption>Tajinebanane’s team only expanded after a year of operations by hiring a logistics specialist to help them scale. <em>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It was a bit hard in the beginning because you had your T-shirts, your stocks, and have to get rid of them and move to a new facility. But from this moment, logistics was not an issue anymore. Then at the same point in time, it was more me taking care of emails, for example. At a point when I was spending six hours answering emails per day, I realized it's not needed that every email to be answered by me. So we did outsource. I think we're really careful in the way we manage our business. I'm not saying it's the best way to do it, we call it like in French which translates to we prefer “putting yourself underwater” and work a lot. Until the moment where really the added value was not there anymore. And then we did find someone to help. So that was 2019. And then 2020 is like when we really build the team. And today with 24 employees, and my sister and me.</p>\n<h2><strong>Fostering a community before selling a single product </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>That's quite a lot of growth. Another big part of it is how Tajinebanane approaches storytelling. Can you let us know what got the first set of customers aware of your products and actually be a paying customer?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>The first thing you have to know is my sister worked in personal support in a hospital. She never studied marketing. She never read books about marketing. She was just very comfortable. She had a MySpace. It was always great. When Facebook arrived, she had a Facebook, it was great, great pictures. Instagram came, she had a great Instagram. I don't think it's something you can learn, how to use social media. I learned marketing in school but I will never be able to be close enough to the talent of my sister. Even if someone's doing a master's in communication, my sister is still going to be better. Not to say my sister is the best.</p>\n<p>So the launch of the company was in August. She started Instagram in April or May. And when she started to do it, it was just content, like talking about maternity, talking about breastfeeding, her story too. We never sold a product, that's the thing you have to remember. We never sell a product except on the launch day where we're going to say like how good this new T-shirt is, but afterward, it's more about content. </p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A model with tattoos wearing a white Tajinebanane T-shirt with a milk carton design.\" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/CLARA_SEGUI_TAJINE_BANANE_V2-29_2.jpg?v=1647252501\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/CLARA_SEGUI_TAJINE_BANANE_V2-29_2.jpg?v=1647252501\">\n<figcaption> By sharing her story with breastfeeding, Ali created content that engaged with her community and it allowed Tajinebanane to thrive.  <em><span> </span>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>What we realized is brands never have big engagement on Instagram. People want to be interested and learn. So that's how I think we managed to keep followers happy, or interested at least. And so, she built this little community but since then we never changed our strategy. you can't have a strategy on communication, I'd say you have guidelines, you have values, and our guideline values haven't changed since the beginning. We're not selling a product, we're selling the concept. We're selling something to help moms in their challenges every day, But that's why it's hard to present Tajinebane as a breastfeeding clothing company. No, it's not just that, it's all this stuff around it.</p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:</strong><span> </span>And did you reach a point where you wanted to invest in marketing, maybe put money behind ads and start having a marketing budget. Did you ever transition into that way of operating?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>Not really, that's the other thing. Our advertising budget is close to zero, we started Google Ads a couple of months ago we did just one campaign in 2019. We spend maybe €50 on Instagram. It's still possible to have natural growth, natural content. And it's just you have to say interesting things. I think you have to touch subjects. You have to find the right influencer to work with.</p>\n<p>I think moms don't want to change the dress code just because they gave birth. But if we would have made a market study, we would have realized probably that it's not an interesting market for us, because if you were a client of breastfeeding clothing you're going to play like it's a bit prettier maybe, it's a bit more practical, but on the other hand, you're not going get all the market of breastfeeding clothing mom, just because you're prettier and more practical. Who we did manage to touch are all the moms, who did not buy breastfeeding clothing, because they do not recognize themselves in them, and they do not find the need for it. And that's where most of our customers are.</p>\n<h2><strong>Nurturing a long-term relationship with customers </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:</strong><span> </span>For parents that move past the stage of breastfeeding, how do you keep that relationship going as they move through different parts of their life?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>I think our first kid clothing was maybe a year after our launch. The thing we realize first is we thought too then the moms are breastfeeding a couple of months, and then it stops. And so, what are you gonna do? You're going to have to renew always your customer base and find new customers. What we realized was not that... You have as many, breastfeeding journeys as mothers basically, What we realized is even if a mom did stop breastfeeding, she kept wearing our clothes, because it was some kind of souvenir. We're not saying that breastfeeding is better than getting the bottle, it was never a topic. But what we realized is like when mom is breastfeeding, they're having a moment with their child which is very, very powerful. And so basically, you're touching a moment which is really important, a lot of emotions, hormones everything. So it's an emotional moment. </p>\n<p>A lot of our clients are not even breastfeeding. They just like the concept, the brands. They support the brands. We also have moms that ordered in 2018, stop breastfeeding 2019 by the second kid or third kid but as long as they bought it the first time they know the brands, they keep following us. That's again, the most important thing about content. Because those people, if they're not clients anymore, you still have to keep them interested. They don't care about your new product because they don't need it anymore. But we managed to keep them because we talked about subjects which are interesting to them, even if they don't breastfeed anymore, you have so many topics around maternity, you can talk for hours about it. And so basically these people we keep, and then when they get pregnant again, I'm telling you, sometimes we are first to know before their husband, they send us a picture of their pregnancy test saying like, \"Oh, I'm going to be able to reorder soon.\"</p>\n<p>Then there’s kids' Clothing too. So we realized when we started making kids' clothing, it didn't really work. But after a year or after 18 months, it started working because we realized it's the same, you start breastfeeding, you prefer buying stuff for yourself. Because when you know someone was going to give birth, you're always going to buy your present for the kid. Like a little teddy bear for the kid, or clothes for the kid. But nobody really thinks about the mom. Like even if it's still a really huge moment for her too. So they want to make themselves happy we realized you start by buying stuff for yourself, and then at some point after a year of breastfeeding, either you stop or either you start buying stuff for your kid too. I'd say now, kids, we're not on the same volume as breastfeeding. But it's a balance. <img alt=\"&lt;p&gt;What we realized is brands never have big engagement on Instagram.

It was two micro-influencer but it was huge for us at the time. And talking about subjects around maternity education and stuff like that. And so they really got interested in the concept. One of them was breastfeeding, she ordered, she liked it, she reposted. And from this moment, my sister spends almost all her day on Instagram. So she was following interesting people on topics. And we started by gifting them. So you send a couple of T-shirts, you send nice notes. And it started like that. And they like the brands, they like the concept, so they always reshare without any proper financial arrangements. But on the other hand, when we gift someone, we never tell them, \"Oh, you have to post, or you have to make a story.\" That's the thing. You know, if you send a gift then it's a gift. So if she (the receiver) doesn't want to talk about it, then she doesn't talk about it. And I think it's this relationship we have with them, it's not a contract. It's more like, “Here you go, we want to make you happy, to please you, now you do whatever you want with it.” And often they repost because they accept the gesture. And they like the brand. They like the product. It's nice to talk about branding with values, or so, I'd say. We never really had sponsor relationships.</p>\n<p>And even if the influencers stop breastfeeding, we still give them other stuff. I mean, we have a relationship, we work with some influencers, we worked since 2018. It's not even working. I mean, it's a relationship. My sister became friends with some of them. So they talked about all the topics and stuff. It was never a financial like relationship or contract, or like, I give you that, you have to give me that in return. If I don't have that many followers, I'm not gonna work with you anymore. It was never like that. And then after you do, of course, giveaways with other brands, that was always something we did from the beginning. And not all the brands wanted to give away with us, so they come naturally too. </p>\n<h2><strong>Running a business with romantic and familial ties </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:</strong><span> </span>How has the relationship with your sister developed over the years?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>I think we are really lucky to be a family business because the important thing with your associates is to be able to tell each other stuff. I find it easier to tell my sister stuff like a friend, It's easier to fight with your sister, and you always fought before, maybe more than to fight with a friend. So already I think we were very straight with each other from the beginning. On a personal level, I think you don't have a notion as an entrepreneur of personal and professional anymore. Like if I’m honest I don't really have this dimension because in three years we only talk about Tajinebane, we don't have really other topics. Of course, we manage to talk about something else from time to time but Tajinebanane is still the main topic coming back to the table. So I think we grew closer We were not neighbors. I mean, I was living in Paris, she was in La Rochelle We were not seeing each other very often. And now, we see each other every day I think I'd say we grew closer, and I think she would say the same thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:</strong><span> </span>What advice do you have for family members who want to run a business together? </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>I don't know. we're siblings and on top of that, both our partners are associated with it. And I always heard people saying I could never work with my boyfriend or my girlfriend. It's very hard and stuff. And I don't know, it never really happened to us somehow. I think, of course, if you don't have a great relationship with your siblings, maybe it's not going to work out. When we were young, we were always together as young kids. We were always doing stuff together. We had a really strong relationship younger, then after we grew a bit apart, but that's a different journey too. And then we came back together with Tajinebane. </p>\n<p>You still have to have a good basis and to split the roles, to split the responsibilities. For example, my sister, I'm never going to make a decision on her part, like she's going to never make a decision on mine. Because we are both CEOs of the company, I have more of the process, the back office part. She has more of our brand and our direction. She's the brand, I'm the company. That's how we do it. We both trust each other on each of our parts. She's never going to tell me like, \"Hey, what did you do now?\" Or something like that. I'm never going to tell her like, \"Why did you do that?\" We leave each other in peace.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The store of Tajinebanane in Bordeaux, France.

Tell us more about having your respective life partners working together. </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>Christina, my partner, I work still a lot with her on different aspects of our missions. You still have your moments where you're on your own. And so, I think everybody has their own responsibility. For example, Christina, my partner, I could be technically her boss. I'm never going to tell her. She's more like the boss of me kind of, you know what I mean? So nobody is the boss, and anybody understands my sister is not the boss of Rafael, I'm not the boss of Christina. It's like in real life, you have to respect your partner. No one is better than the other. And at work, it's the same. So I think it's great. We spend a lot of time together. And I think the other thing where it's great to be with your partner, is because I think during the first year of starting the business if she was not in Tajinebane, she would've left me. You work extra hard 24/7, you're never there. And who's best to understand that if she's living in it herself. </p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>And what are their respective roles?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>So Christina, she's German. She's more on international development. focusing on Germany because now we have someone an English speaker as well for English speaking countries. It's like a lot of administrative aspects, and we do it together. And Rafael was going to be in the boutique, And he helps my sister on Instagram. So that's why Christina never really works with my sister, and I don't really work with Raf. And so basically, Raf helps my sister to answer messages on Instagram. So even today, Instagram, if you text on Instagram, the one that's going to answer you is gonna be my sister or her boyfriend. Even Rafael became friends with some of her clients, they talk about all the topics and stuff like that. It was always like that, like a family. Even our customers recognize themself as a big family. And we were always really, very close with our customers. And we don't even see them as customers. </p>\n<h2><strong>Recalibrating after a growth “crisis”</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>Tell us more about the retail store and how it acts as a community hub. </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>Most of our customers spend an hour in the shop, and any other shops in the world would be with the interest of kicking the customer out as quickly as possible. For us, it's the other way around. Even if a customer spends three hours and does not buy anything at the end, it's okay too. You have to be able to feel like this person had a good moment. For the drinks, we offer them even if you don't order. If you want a coffee, we're not gonna make you pay for it. We believe in don't treat your customer like you will not like to be treated by a company kind of.</p>\n<p>That was always the spirit, and for the loyalty program, it was the same. We built a loyalty program. We imagined this loyalty program, we did not calculate it. For example, if given that I'm gonna have that in return, and it's gonna cost me that and stuff. We just made it how we would've liked to have a loyalty program. So you see our loyalty program today nobody's doing that. We offer sometimes €40 as a voucher, no company is doing that. And it was more like to be nice, to reward actually the clients who spend like thousands, hundreds of thousands of euros in our shop.</p>\n<p>Of course, we are a business. So you have to think about profits, If you're not profitable, you're not going to work out in any case. So there's always those two dimensions, and you have to keep at least the balance may never put the business first. </p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A model wears a sweatshirt from Tajinebanane against a blue sky background.\" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/IMG_0078_2.jpg?v=1647252850\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/IMG_0078_2.jpg?v=1647252850\">\n<figcaption>For Tajinebanane the hardest part of growing quickly is managing the large expenses and cashflows when sales fluctuated.<em><span> </span>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>Was it ever scary to have all four of your livelihood tied to the business? </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>We don't really think about it. It's maybe the growth of the company is how the thing turns out, but since the beginning somehow, all the signals are green, The first difficulties we had was this year. This year was the worst, I like to call it a growth crisis. It's hard to run a business that's not working. But it's even harder to run a business that's working crazy. Or maybe not harder, but more dangerous. Because the problem is your revenue is growing, expenses are growing the same way. And at some point when you start to make less revenue, the expenses don't decrease anymore. That's the problem with expenses. I think from 2020 we made like 400% growth or something like over the year, 300 or 400%, I can't remember exactly. And this year we're at 50%.</p>\n<p>Which is still great, most company will be really happy for growth like that. But going from 300% to 50% growth, in your plans, it was not the same, because we did not plan on 300 again this year, but we did plan stocks in a way that would have a big growth compared to last year actually. It was still growing but not as big as expected. </p>\n<p>If you have way too much stock you spend a lot of money on expenses in general. And so it was a transitional year but it's a good thing too, because at least last year, we have this year to base ourselves on because that's the hard thing with a growing company. When you grow too quickly, you can't base yourself. And that's very important to do planning to know how many units you produce, for example. And I think next year is going to be the easy one, and it's going to be like the one where basically I'm comfortable enough to say how much revenue I'm gonna make next year. </p>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong> What were some things you did to gain financial clarity and to have a better grasp on the business again? </p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>I was very invested in Tajinebane, I way too much into figures, I was way too involved personally and psychologically speaking into the company. The first thing that was important to do is to take a step backward on your own business, You have to take a step backward to really understand what's wrong today, what's not working as well as last year?</p>\n<p>And so that was the hardest thing to do for me this year, at least. Because when you every day into the account, every day into the sales, every day into the stock. a few years ago we had no money, now I'm gonna pay maybe within one day $100,000. I'm gonna make the transfer to suppliers. Like I'm buying a house every month.</p>\n<p>And second, you have to know what's not working today. It's normal to be less profitable as much as you grow because expenses are static sometimes. And to take one step at a time, and to be optimistic. </p>\n<h2><strong>The journey of finding the right ecommerce solution and plans for an impactful future</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>What are some tools, apps that really helped you build, and are there any favorites that you can share?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:</strong><span> </span>We're on Shopify since February 2020, We were before on WooCommerce. we started on Wix. So all the steps, we had to change the solution. Wix, the problem was with the logistics, so we could not interface with our logistics software. So we went on WooCommerce, but WooCommerce was full of bugs. but for us, it was not possible. So when we had a lot of traffic on the website, for example, that people could not order or spend sometimes an hour to order because it was too many people. The website was lagging, the server was lagging. It was someone from Shopify who knew the brand or something like that, and they contacted us because we were starting to become famous for how our website was lagging, people knew. And so with Shopify partner presented us with an agency in Paris, it was really good. We built our first website. And since we never lag or something, you can do anything you want.</p>\n<p>The first app we took I think we had one app, which is called Intercom. I don't know if you know, it's customer service, So you have a chat on their website, and customers can reach you through this chatbox. We have also another solution and we love it, it's Klaviyo. So we're fully integrated, so that's great too. And we use Klaviyo, it's a CRM solution. we use it for our main loyalty program stuff because they have something we call flows, automated emails. So basically, I know it's your birthday, you receive an email with a code But Klaviyo is great to segment, it's very user-friendly. I think Shopify understood everything, and if you don't do the switch today, you might get in trouble at some point because, I don't know, now every time we think about a new solution, we think about how it's integrated into Shopify, we have also Fitle, I don't know if you know, it's a sizing tool, recommendation tool.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\" An array of clothing on racks within the Tajinebanane retail store.\" data-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnameda_1.jpg?v=1647252943\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnameda_1.jpg?v=1647252943\">\n<figcaption>Ali and Marvine placed an emphasis on building a charity aspect into Tajinebanane by offer clothing to the less fortunate and supporting various organizations.<em><span> </span>Tajinebanane</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>Shuang:<span> </span></strong>Amazing. And then looking forward, are there any plans or news that you can share that you want to highlight?</p>\n<p><strong>Marvin:<span> </span></strong>The first plan would be to keep things the way they are. As I told you before, profits come after keeping the spirit. We have an amazing team, we found employees which are really invested, they love the message, they love the company. They probably do feel like they are invested in us today. And to keep the company like that, to keep the employees like that. And after more business speaking, we already are like really big in France, We want to expand a bit abroad too.<br>Europe is a great market for us. We're not focusing too much on the U.S. yet. We started it, but it's pretty particular in the U.S. when you're a European business. I mean, it's a lot of investment, we're focusing on Europe now. And maybe we are planning on opening a new boutique in Paris, this one's working well. So maybe extend the concept too. also really important like a part of the company, which is in the social charity area. So since we started, basically, we always made partnerships with associations. So we, for example, created something that did exist before, but we adapted it to our company. But the concept of... In France, I don't know if it's the same in the U.S., but for example, you go to a bar and pay yourself for a coffee and you can leave to the barman like one extra euro. And if less fortunate people want to have a coffee, basically it's this concept of you go the bar and it's five extra euro there, so here, you can have your coffee or something like that. So we did put the exact same concept on the website, so people can leave a euro, €2, €5, €10, whatever. And we turn all this money into... Like we give clothes at the same time. So for example, if you buy a T-shirt, let's say €18, we got €18, but we give €18. We're not charging like 44, as it's really what we paid, covered by the donation of clients. And we do that... It's always one going out. Every three months we change the association. After we do fundraising. And my sister has always wanted, this her plan since she started Tajinebane's to like build the Tajinebane foundation. she's invited to the Ministry for the rights of women to breastfeed. She's becoming a bit of a public figure. It's funny to say it like that, but she has a plan of her own too in this area. So we take it one step at a time, It's no big plans for the future because we realized that when you make big plans, it anyway never happens. That's the thing. </p>",

It’s no longer an option—it’s what customers demand.

Even small steps in the right direction can lighten your footprint—and meet customers where they are.</p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">\n<div itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/FAQPage">\n<h2>Sustainable clothing brands FAQ</h2>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">\n<h3 itemprop="name">What is slow fashion?</h3>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">\n<div itemprop="text">\n<p>Think about what defines fast fashion: high output, speedy production, low-cost materials. Slow fashion takes the opposite approach, not sacrificing care for humans and the environment for the sake of speed and cost cutting. It approaches fashion from the perspective of doing no harm and leaving no footprint—and sometimes that takes longer.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">\n<h3 itemprop="name">What is greenwashing?</h3>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">\n<div itemprop="text">\n<p>Greenwashing is the practice of brands and companies claiming to be more environmentally conscious than they are. It refers to a disconnect between the promises a company makes and its actions. Consumers are becoming increasingly savvy with green terminology more widely understood. Greenwashing can erode consumer trust, so be transparent and own your impact.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">\n<h3 itemprop="name">How can a sustainable clothing brand earn certifications?</h3>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">\n<div itemprop="text">\n<p>Each organization responsible for granting sustainability accreditation will have its own set of rules and standards. The more you know about your supply chain and the closer you are to it, the more you’ll be able to control the impact they have to meet these standards. Usually, organizations will have a clear application process or form on their website.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">\n<h3 itemprop="name">How can fashion brands be more sustainable?</h3>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">\n<div itemprop="text">\n<p>There are a number of ways fashion brands can be more sustainable. A truly sustainable business considers impact at every stage in the supply chain, from sourcing to shipping. Start small to get there by doing an audit of your business practices and identifying the biggest areas for improvement. Simply switching to biodegradable shipping materials or donating proceeds to offsetting projects is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/sustainable-business-practices">Sustainable for the Long Term: 7 Ways to Stay True to Your Values—and Meet Customer Expectations</a></li>\n<li aria-level="1">​​<a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/run-a-more-sustainable-business">4 Simple, Low-Cost Ways to Run a More Sustainable Business</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">\n<h3 itemprop="name">How do you start a sustainable clothing business?</h3>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">\n<div itemprop="text">\n<p>tarting any clothing business requires many steps, from identifying your niche and audience and determining business model (handmade, factory produced, resales) to developing your brand and setting up your online store.

Slow fashion takes the opposite approach, not sacrificing care for humans and the environment for the sake of speed and cost cutting.

Simply switching to biodegradable shipping materials or donating proceeds to offsetting projects is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/sustainable-business-practices">Sustainable for the Long Term: 7 Ways to Stay True to Your Values—and Meet Customer Expectations</a></li>\n<li aria-level="1">​​<a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/run-a-more-sustainable-business">4 Simple, Low-Cost Ways to Run a More Sustainable Business</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">\n<h3 itemprop="name">How do you start a sustainable clothing business?</h3>\n<div itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">\n<div itemprop="text">\n<p>tarting any clothing business requires many steps, from identifying your niche and audience and determining business model (handmade, factory produced, resales) to developing your brand and setting up your online store.

Usually, marketing calendars show the campaigns you’ll run, promotions and sales you plan to have, product launches, and any holidays you’ll plan marketing materials around. Larger businesses might have multiple marketing calendars across disciplines like social media, editorial, and product.

They make creative space to plan for collaborations that take time.</p>\n<p>Most of all, spending the time to create a marketing calendar lets you think through what kinds of campaigns and strategies will cut through the noise.

What exactly, as a business, are you trying to accomplish? </p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsalexP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alex Greifeld</a>, an ecommerce expert who has worked in the industry since 2011, recommends starting with the big picture rather than tactically. Essentially, establish what meal you want to make for dinner rather than starting on step three of the recipe. </p>\n<p>“A lot of digital marketers and eCom practitioners skip right from a vague objective to tactics. We start the year with a sales target and then write up a list of optimizations or new technology that we think will get us there,” writes Alex in a recent installment of the<span> </span><a href="https://nobestpractices.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">No Best Practices</a><span> </span>newsletter. “A general rule of thumb—if your strategy could be applied interchangeably to any business, it’s not actually a strategy.” </p>\n<p>By building a thoughtful marketing calendar based on the goals you have as a business, you lessen the risk of throwing random tactics at the wall and hoping they’ll stick. This leaves room to allocate time and money more effectively so you can take big swings when they make sense for you. </p>\n<p>A few questions you should ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1">Who am I partnering with?</li>\n<li aria-level="1">What promotions or events are already scheduled?</li>\n<li aria-level="1">Which campaigns are fixed and which ones can be moved around?</li>\n<li aria-level="1">Where can I leave space for new opportunities that pop up?</li>\n<li aria-level="1">What central messaging do I need to repeat?</li>\n</ul>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">\n<p><strong>🚦Before we get started…<span> </span></strong>Do you have a marketing strategy for your business?

Larger businesses, as we mentioned above, most likely have different types of marketing calendars for each marketing segment, like editorial (blog), social media, product, or email. These businesses usually segment marketing into different teams, or hire at least a couple of dedicated marketing people responsible for each category.</p>\n<p>For small businesses, a marketing calendar usually covers all marketing channels. </p>\n<h2 id="5">How do you build a marketing calendar? </h2>\n<p>Hopefully now you’ve established the overarching goals you’d like to achieve with your marketing activities. Next, we’ll walk you through the seven-step process of creating a marketing calendar for your business. </p>\n<h3 id="6">Step 1: Determine how long you’ll plan for </h3>\n<h4>One full calendar year</h4>\n<p>For some businesses, planning out a marketing calendar a year in advance makes sense. You might need that much time to work on a large-scale event that requires coordination with multiple vendors. This also allows you to get a more holistic idea of the campaigns and promotions you might run over the course of an entire year. </p>\n<p>For example, you might run two big promotions a year, one for Black Friday Cyber Monday and the other during the summer or for a major holiday like Valentine’s Day. Year-long planning gives you the longest lead time, but it also has the highest potential for change. A year-long plan doesn’t take into consideration world events and cultural shifts or trends, so you’ll have to leave extra flexibility for when things inevitably change. </p>\n<h4>One quarter </h4>\n<p>Quarter planning sits right in the middle, and gives you solid lead time while also making space for anything that pops up throughout the year. This is a great option if you’re looking to have enough time to execute campaigns while taking stock four times per year to see how your calendar performed and what you can do to improve it. </p>\n<h4>One month </h4>\n<p>The shortest option, planning a marketing calendar one month at a time gives you the most flexibility. It also makes you more nimble to jump on trending topics and create campaigns around them as a business. The downside is that you’ll spend more time each month planning for the future, which can get unwieldy. You have the highest risk here of pivoting to a tactic-led, rather than an objective, strategic-led approach. </p>\n<figure><img alt="A person holds an ipad that shows a calendar with various appointments next to a cup of coffee" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/marketing-calendar-1.jpg?v=1647459732" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/marketing-calendar-1.jpg?v=1647459732">\n<figcaption><em>Unsplash</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id="7">Step 2: Decide which channels you’ll include </h3>\n<p>Your marketing calendar should include campaigns you’ll run across all of the major channels for your business. Consider what your main marketing channels are. For example, if you are most active via email, TikTok, and SMS, those are the channels you’ll include activities for in your marketing calendar. </p>\n<h3 id="8">Step 3: Build in flexibility for when things change </h3>\n<p>“The purpose of a marketing plan isn’t to create a step-by-step, never-fail manual. It’s to have a roadmap to help you accomplish the best-case scenario,” writes Elise Dopson in a recent article that covers how to build a<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/marketing-plan">marketing plan</a>. </p>\n<p>The same rings true for creating an impactful marketing calendar. How will you accommodate workflows for “in the moment” events you want to latch onto? You’ll also want to make a plan for when campaigns don’t go as planned. For example, you might have run an email campaign around the start of spring that didn’t perform as well or that made more sales than you had hoped. Think through how you’ll adjust and pivot your future campaigns based on the learnings of previous ones. </p>\n<h3 id="9">Step 4: Choose the kinds of campaigns you’ll run</h3>\n<p>A marketing campaign is a series of messages around one central topic. A campaign can be as simple as a series of social media posts advertising a promotion, and as complex as a collection of emails, social posts, SMS texts, and a new landing page promoting a product launch. </p>\n<p>As you plan your marketing calendar, consider which types of campaigns you’ll run.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Sales and promotions.<span> </span></strong>Notify prospective customers that existing inventory is going on sale, or entice them to make a purchase with a discount code.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Holiday campaigns.</strong><span> </span>Center messaging around a major or minor holiday, like Mother’s Day or Halloween. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content-driven campaigns.</strong><span> </span>Put out content on your email and social platforms around a central theme or idea. For example, Equator Coffee sent a recent email focused on its Earth-minded packaging. </li>\n<li aria-level="1">\n<strong>Giveaways and contests.<span> </span></strong>Will you run any giveaways or contests to increase engagement and to get more emails or followers? Note where you’ll slot them in on your marketing calendar.<strong> </strong>\n</li>\n<li aria-level="1">\n<strong>Product launches.</strong><span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/product-launch">These</a><span> </span>are often larger-scale campaigns. They require more lead time in terms of both product development and pre-launch content, like emails or social media posts.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img class="block block--bordered lazyloaded" alt="A screenshot of an email sent by Equator Coffee that shows an image of a bag of Equator Coffee" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/marketing-calendar-equator.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647459794" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/marketing-calendar-equator.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647459794">\n<figcaption>Equator Coffee recently put out an email about the sustainability measures it takes as a company.

They might include new product launches, Black Friday Cyber Monday promotions, or a big sale you run every year. Your full team works on these campaigns, and you’ll engage people across all of your active channels. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1">\n<strong>Tier 2:<span> </span></strong>Slightly less in scale than Tier 1 launches, Tier 2s don’t require as much lead time or planning, but still involve a hefty amount of work. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1">\n<strong>Tier 3:<span> </span></strong>Tier 3s are smaller campaigns that require a moderate amount of planning and execution. These could be local to one of your marketing channels or span a few, but they only require a week or two of planning. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1">\n<strong>Tier 4:</strong><span> </span>Consisting of a couple of social media posts to celebrate a holiday, or an email or two to tell a story, Tier 4 launches are easy to put together quickly and require little to no lead time to be effective. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id="11">Step 6: Narrow down the holidays you’ll build campaigns around</h3>\n<p>Besides the major holidays, there are<span> </span><em>tons</em><span> </span>of smaller scale ones throughout each year.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to run a campaign around every holiday. In fact, that would overwhelm your audience. Instead, select the holidays and days of celebration that work best for your brand. If you sell athletic apparel, you might choose to run a promotion or social media campaign around International Yoga Day. Similarly, if you sell vintage fine jewelry, you might do the same around Valentine’s Day. </p>\n<p>For example, sustainable toilet paper brand Who Gives a Crap sent a cheeky email on 2/22/22. The language plays with the connotation of #2 and uses it as a jumping off point to remind folks to “top up” their toilet paper stash. Platforms like<span> </span><a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/resources/twitter-marketing-calendar.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a><span> </span>and<span> </span><a href="https://www.calendarlabs.com/holidays/international/2022" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Calendar Labs</a><span> </span>provide resources for key global moments and international days of celebration you can drum up buzz around. </p>\n<figure><img class="block block--bordered lazyloaded" alt="A screenshot of a Who Gives a Crap email celebrating 2/22/2022" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/who-gives-a-crap-2-cal.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647459902" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/who-gives-a-crap-2-cal.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647459902">\n<figcaption><em>Who Gives a Crap</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Taylor Holiday, Managing Partner of Common Thread Collective, recommends<span> </span><a href="https://commonthreadco.com/blogs/coachs-corner/ecommerce-marketing-calendar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">creating a marketing calendar with at least four peaks</a><span> </span>if you’re planning for an entire year. These peaks represent your marketing campaigns and create a “calendar that drives performance through storytelling and imperative purchase opportunities,” writes Taylor. </p>\n<h3 id="12">Step 7: Identify key milestones for your business</h3>\n<p>New product launches, collections, or collaborations are big milestones for your brand. These are opportunities to engage with your community and make a big splash. If you’re planning for one or all of these, add them to your marketing calendar ASAP. That will give you ample lead time to launch a more creative campaign that adds real value to your customers. </p>\n<h2 id="13">What tools can you use to build ecommerce marketing calendars? </h2>\n<p>Go the simple route with Google Calendar, or select a more robust tool like Coda.

Usually, marketing calendars show the campaigns you’ll run, promotions and sales you plan to have, product launches, and any holidays you’ll plan marketing materials around. Larger businesses might have multiple marketing calendars across disciplines like social media, editorial, and product.

They allow you time to staff projects you need extra support on or to hire and send products to influencers. They make creative space to plan for collaborations that take time.</p>\n<p>Most of all, spending the time to create a marketing calendar lets you think through what kinds of campaigns and strategies will cut through the noise.

What exactly, as a business, are you trying to accomplish? </p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsalexP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alex Greifeld</a>, an ecommerce expert who has worked in the industry since 2011, recommends starting with the big picture rather than tactically. Essentially, establish what meal you want to make for dinner rather than starting on step three of the recipe. </p>\n<p>“A lot of digital marketers and eCom practitioners skip right from a vague objective to tactics. We start the year with a sales target and then write up a list of optimizations or new technology that we think will get us there,” writes Alex in a recent installment of the<span> </span><a href="https://nobestpractices.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">No Best Practices</a><span> </span>newsletter. “A general rule of thumb—if your strategy could be applied interchangeably to any business, it’s not actually a strategy.” </p>\n<p>By building a thoughtful marketing calendar based on the goals you have as a business, you lessen the risk of throwing random tactics at the wall and hoping they’ll stick. This leaves room to allocate time and money more effectively so you can take big swings when they make sense for you. </p>\n<p>A few questions you should ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1">Who am I partnering with?</li>\n<li aria-level="1">What promotions or events are already scheduled?</li>\n<li aria-level="1">Which campaigns are fixed and which ones can be moved around?</li>\n<li aria-level="1">Where can I leave space for new opportunities that pop up?</li>\n<li aria-level="1">What central messaging do I need to repeat?</li>\n</ul>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">\n<p><strong>🚦Before we get started…<span> </span></strong>Do you have a marketing strategy for your business? Learn more about establishing a marketing strategy:<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/marketing-strategy">The 5-Step Marketing Strategy to Grow Your Business</a></p>\n</div>\n<h2 id="4">How are marketing calendars different for small versus enterprise businesses?</h2>\n<p>Your marketing calendar will look different if you run a small business or an enterprise-level company. Larger businesses, as we mentioned above, most likely have different types of marketing calendars for each marketing segment, like editorial (blog), social media, product, or email. These businesses usually segment marketing into different teams, or hire at least a couple of dedicated marketing people responsible for each category.</p>\n<p>For small businesses, a marketing calendar usually covers all marketing channels. </p>\n<h2 id="5">How do you build a marketing calendar? </h2>\n<p>Hopefully now you’ve established the overarching goals you’d like to achieve with your marketing activities. Next, we’ll walk you through the seven-step process of creating a marketing calendar for your business. </p>\n<h3 id="6">Step 1: Determine how long you’ll plan for </h3>\n<h4>One full calendar year</h4>\n<p>For some businesses, planning out a marketing calendar a year in advance makes sense. You might need that much time to work on a large-scale event that requires coordination with multiple vendors. This also allows you to get a more holistic idea of the campaigns and promotions you might run over the course of an entire year. </p>\n<p>For example, you might run two big promotions a year, one for Black Friday Cyber Monday and the other during the summer or for a major holiday like Valentine’s Day. Year-long planning gives you the longest lead time, but it also has the highest potential for change. A year-long plan doesn’t take into consideration world events and cultural shifts or trends, so you’ll have to leave extra flexibility for when things inevitably change. </p>\n<h4>One quarter </h4>\n<p>Quarter planning sits right in the middle, and gives you solid lead time while also making space for anything that pops up throughout the year. This is a great option if you’re looking to have enough time to execute campaigns while taking stock four times per year to see how your calendar performed and what you can do to improve it. </p>\n<h4>One month </h4>\n<p>The shortest option, planning a marketing calendar one month at a time gives you the most flexibility. It also makes you more nimble to jump on trending topics and create campaigns around them as a business. The downside is that you’ll spend more time each month planning for the future, which can get unwieldy. You have the highest risk here of pivoting to a tactic-led, rather than an objective, strategic-led approach. </p>\n<figure><img alt="A person holds an ipad that shows a calendar with various appointments next to a cup of coffee" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/marketing-calendar-1.jpg?v=1647459732" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/marketing-calendar-1.jpg?v=1647459732">\n<figcaption><em>Unsplash</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id="7">Step 2: Decide which channels you’ll include </h3>\n<p>Your marketing calendar should include campaigns you’ll run across all of the major channels for your business. Consider what your main marketing channels are. For example, if you are most active via email, TikTok, and SMS, those are the channels you’ll include activities for in your marketing calendar. </p>\n<h3 id="8">Step 3: Build in flexibility for when things change </h3>\n<p>“The purpose of a marketing plan isn’t to create a step-by-step, never-fail manual. It’s to have a roadmap to help you accomplish the best-case scenario,” writes Elise Dopson in a recent article that covers how to build a<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/marketing-plan">marketing plan</a>. </p>\n<p>The same rings true for creating an impactful marketing calendar. How will you accommodate workflows for “in the moment” events you want to latch onto? You’ll also want to make a plan for when campaigns don’t go as planned. For example, you might have run an email campaign around the start of spring that didn’t perform as well or that made more sales than you had hoped. Think through how you’ll adjust and pivot your future campaigns based on the learnings of previous ones. </p>\n<h3 id="9">Step 4: Choose the kinds of campaigns you’ll run</h3>\n<p>A marketing campaign is a series of messages around one central topic. A campaign can be as simple as a series of social media posts advertising a promotion, and as complex as a collection of emails, social posts, SMS texts, and a new landing page promoting a product launch. </p>\n<p>As you plan your marketing calendar, consider which types of campaigns you’ll run.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Sales and promotions.<span> </span></strong>Notify prospective customers that existing inventory is going on sale, or entice them to make a purchase with a discount code.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Holiday campaigns.</strong><span> </span>Center messaging around a major or minor holiday, like Mother’s Day or Halloween. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content-driven campaigns.</strong><span> </span>Put out content on your email and social platforms around a central theme or idea. For example, Equator Coffee sent a recent email focused on its Earth-minded packaging. </li>\n<li aria-level="1">\n<strong>Giveaways and contests.<span> </span></strong>Will you run any giveaways or contests to increase engagement and to get more emails or followers? Note where you’ll slot them in on your marketing calendar.<strong> </strong>\n</li>\n<li aria-level="1">\n<strong>Product launches.</strong><span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/product-launch">These</a><span> </span>are often larger-scale campaigns. They require more lead time in terms of both product development and pre-launch content, like emails or social media posts.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img class="block block--bordered lazyloaded" alt="A screenshot of an email sent by Equator Coffee that shows an image of a bag of Equator Coffee" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/marketing-calendar-equator.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647459794" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/marketing-calendar-equator.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647459794">\n<figcaption>Equator Coffee recently put out an email about the sustainability measures it takes as a company.

They might include new product launches, Black Friday Cyber Monday promotions, or a big sale you run every year. Your full team works on these campaigns, and you’ll engage people across all of your active channels. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1">\n<strong>Tier 2:<span> </span></strong>Slightly less in scale than Tier 1 launches, Tier 2s don’t require as much lead time or planning, but still involve a hefty amount of work. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1">\n<strong>Tier 3:<span> </span></strong>Tier 3s are smaller campaigns that require a moderate amount of planning and execution. These could be local to one of your marketing channels or span a few, but they only require a week or two of planning. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1">\n<strong>Tier 4:</strong><span> </span>Consisting of a couple of social media posts to celebrate a holiday, or an email or two to tell a story, Tier 4 launches are easy to put together quickly and require little to no lead time to be effective. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id="11">Step 6: Narrow down the holidays you’ll build campaigns around</h3>\n<p>Besides the major holidays, there are<span> </span><em>tons</em><span> </span>of smaller scale ones throughout each year.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to run a campaign around every holiday. In fact, that would overwhelm your audience. Instead, select the holidays and days of celebration that work best for your brand. If you sell athletic apparel, you might choose to run a promotion or social media campaign around International Yoga Day. Similarly, if you sell vintage fine jewelry, you might do the same around Valentine’s Day. </p>\n<p>For example, sustainable toilet paper brand Who Gives a Crap sent a cheeky email on 2/22/22. The language plays with the connotation of #2 and uses it as a jumping off point to remind folks to “top up” their toilet paper stash. Platforms like<span> </span><a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/resources/twitter-marketing-calendar.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a><span> </span>and<span> </span><a href="https://www.calendarlabs.com/holidays/international/2022" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Calendar Labs</a><span> </span>provide resources for key global moments and international days of celebration you can drum up buzz around. </p>\n<figure><img class="block block--bordered lazyloaded" alt="A screenshot of a Who Gives a Crap email celebrating 2/22/2022" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/who-gives-a-crap-2-cal.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647459902" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/who-gives-a-crap-2-cal.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647459902">\n<figcaption><em>Who Gives a Crap</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Taylor Holiday, Managing Partner of Common Thread Collective, recommends<span> </span><a href="https://commonthreadco.com/blogs/coachs-corner/ecommerce-marketing-calendar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">creating a marketing calendar with at least four peaks</a><span> </span>if you’re planning for an entire year. These peaks represent your marketing campaigns and create a “calendar that drives performance through storytelling and imperative purchase opportunities,” writes Taylor. </p>\n<h3 id="12">Step 7: Identify key milestones for your business</h3>\n<p>New product launches, collections, or collaborations are big milestones for your brand. These are opportunities to engage with your community and make a big splash. If you’re planning for one or all of these, add them to your marketing calendar ASAP. That will give you ample lead time to launch a more creative campaign that adds real value to your customers. </p>\n<h2 id="13">What tools can you use to build ecommerce marketing calendars? </h2>\n<p>Go the simple route with Google Calendar, or select a more robust tool like Coda.

More than half of the world’s population uses social media, with a majority of us logging in at least once a day. </p>\n<p>With numbers like these, social media marketing has massive ROI potential, but driving sales on social media still comes with its challenges⁠—one being getting your followers to<span> </span><em>leave</em><span> </span>a social media app to make a purchase on your online store. </p>\n<p>However, this might not be such a big challenge anymore, thanks to a fast-growing ecommerce trend: social commerce.</p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">\n<h4>Table of Contents</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-commerce#1">What is social commerce?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-commerce#2">What are the benefits of social commerce?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-commerce#3">What are the best social commerce platforms for retailers?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-commerce#4">How to sell using social commerce: Tips and best practices</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id="1">What is social commerce?</h2>\n<p>Social commerce (sometimes called social shopping) exists at the cross section of ecommerce and social media. In basic terms, social commerce is when businesses, brands, and creators sell on sales channels located directly on their social media profiles or their followers’ social media feeds. </p>\n<p>In the past couple of years, social media platforms have developed tools like shoppable posts, on-site storefronts, and dedicated checkouts that allow users to discover new products, explore new brands, and make purchases—all without ever leaving their social network. </p>\n<p>While the practice is still evolving, one thing is certain; social commerce is incredibly profitable. According to<span> </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1231944/social-commerce-global-market-size/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Statista</a>, social commerce generated about $475 billion in revenue in 2020, and is expected to grow at a rate of 28.4% annually, reaching $3.37 trillion by 2028. </p>\n<p>Insight into why social commerce is so profitable can be traced all the way back to 2005, when<span> </span><a href="https://genuinevc.com/2005/12/06/the-beginnings-of-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the term was first coined</a><span> </span>by David Beisel, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a product is directly integrated into becoming content itself, it bypasses the normal filter that consumers put up to ignore or at least be skeptical of the advertising. And when this advertorial content is generated by a friend, a special element of trust is integrated into the advertorial relationship that wasn’t present otherwise.</p>\n<footer><cite>David Beisel, Co-Founder and Partner at<span> </span><a href="https://nextview.vc/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NextView Ventures</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it all boils down to trust.</p>\n<p>Long before Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram⁠—when Facebook was still in its infancy and the term “social commerce” characterized group-buying sites like Groupon and LivingSocial, Beisal understood the potential behind the symbiosis of ecommerce and social media.</p>\n<h2 id="2">What are the benefits of social commerce?</h2>\n<p>By meeting your target audience on their own turf, social commerce offers many advantages over traditional ecommerce. If it isn’t already a part of your<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-media-marketing-strategy">social media marketing strategy</a>, here’s why it should be: </p>\n<h3>1. Less friction in the checkout process.</h3>\n<p>In traditional ecommerce, social media is used to redirect traffic to an ecommerce site where users can purchase. While this model can work, the biggest deterrent is the friction it creates in the buying process. </p>\n<p>Following through on a purchase requires users to stop what they’re doing on social media, go to an external site, and then return to where they left off. This process might not seem arduous, but the effort involved is just arduous enough for many users to avoid. </p>\n<p>These additional steps required to make a purchase are what we’re talking about when we refer to friction in the checkout process. Each step makes purchasing a little more complicated, and at each step, users have a chance to decide the process is no longer worth it. </p>\n<p>But when you use social commerce tools within a social media platform, you greatly reduce that friction. Users that stumble on your content already have everything they need right in front of them to make a purchase. Purchasing from you is almost as effortless as tapping Like or Follow.</p>\n<figure><img alt="vessi-facebook-ad-with-shop-now-button" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image4_4467d23f-8e36-4279-81bc-85e76d41a1f7.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647543921" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image4_4467d23f-8e36-4279-81bc-85e76d41a1f7.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647543921">\n<figcaption>Facebook’s Shop Now button reduces friction by allowing users to browse products directly from their Facebook feeds.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Potential customers will still make a lot of considerations before purchasing from you, but when they’re able to buy directly from the point of discovery, the effort involved in the purchase won’t be one of them.</p>\n<h3>2. Drive social media engagement while you sell. </h3>\n<p>A good social media<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/marketing-plan">marketing plan</a><span> </span>needs to perform the simultaneous functions of finding new audiences and maintaining good relationships with existing ones. </p>\n<p>When you use social commerce, you can engage with these two audiences simultaneously. Posts driven to create brand awareness can also feature buying options for others who are in the consideration phase.</p>\n<figure><img alt="spruce-toronto-tagged-products-on-group-post" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image2_a7ce2e53-910a-4f23-9f05-35e3cc3f10cc.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544173" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image2_a7ce2e53-910a-4f23-9f05-35e3cc3f10cc.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544173">\n<figcaption>Via<span> </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SpruceToronto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Spruce Toronto</a>. In this post, Spruce has tagged its products in a post shared with a neighborhood group for Cabbagetown, Toronto.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>A bonus feature of this dynamic is the users who may fall down the<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a><span> </span>a little faster than usual. With awareness, consideration, and conversion all happening in the same place, users who’ve just discovered your brand may have all the info they need to decide your product is worth buying, and the features they need to buy it. </p>\n<h3>3. The social commerce market is huge.</h3>\n<p>Grouping social media users by their follows, likes, or interests makes finding your<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/target-market">target market</a><span> </span>a breeze. But if you’re doing this<span> </span><em>without</em><span> </span>social commerce features, you’re likely missing out on a lot of potential sales. </p>\n<p>The number of people who report having purchased via social commerce has been<span> </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1120128/number-social-buyers-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">growing since 2019</a>. As users warm up to social shopping, this trend is expected to continue. By 2025, it’s estimated that around 37% of Americans will have made a purchase through social media.</p>\n<p>With more businesses adopting social commerce, the ability to buy directly on social media will become less of an extravagance and more an expectation. Adopting social commerce now will put you in prime position to stay on top of this trend and stop missing out on lost sales.</p>\n<h3>4. Generate social proof while you sell. </h3>\n<p><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-proof">Social proof</a><span> </span>is a psychological phenomenon that describes our tendency to rely on the opinion of others when making purchase decisions. </p>\n<p>In ecommerce, social proof can take the form of product reviews,<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/customer-testimonials">customer testimonials</a>, case studies, public praise, or even just knowledge of a product’s popularity. If you’ve ever watched a movie or TV show just because everyone seems to be talking about it, you’ve experienced the power of social proof. </p>\n<p>Social media is a first-touch point for a lot of users, which makes highly visible social proof a valuable tool for picking up followers and building an audience. When you sell via social commerce, that social proof also becomes a valuable tool for picking up sales. </p>\n<p>Encourage purchasers to share pics or videos of your product. Ask for reviews or endorsements from influencers with highly engaged audiences. Just seeing that users are enjoying your product will help encourage others to do the same.</p>\n<figure><img alt="wunderkids-canada-post-featuring-customer-with-products" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image3_fc866812-b693-451d-8bf2-580ecedefe0e.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544385" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image3_fc866812-b693-451d-8bf2-580ecedefe0e.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544385">\n<figcaption>Via<span> </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/wunderkids.ca/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wunderkids Canada</a>. Here, Wunderkids generates social proof by sharing an Instagram post from one of its followers that features its product.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>One top of this, your social shopping posts themselves act as a type of social proof. When online shoppers see their peers liking, commenting, and sharing your posts, they’ll feel more confident in making the decision to buy your product. </p>\n<h3>5. Easily accommodate the growing number of mobile shoppers.</h3>\n<p>The number of<span> </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-commerce-shopping-trends-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">mobile ecommerce sales</a><span> </span>reached $359 billion in 2021, a 15.2% increase from 2020. Industry experts estimate that by 2025, mobile ecommerce sales will account for 44.2% of retail ecommerce sales in the US, for a grand total of $728.28 billion. </p>\n<p>As online shoppers warm up to the idea of shopping on their mobile devices, and social media networks adopt more tools that help facilitate it, an easy-to-use mobile-ready storefront will become more and more crucial to the success of any online retailer. </p>\n<p>You might be thinking,<span> </span><em>So what? I have a responsive, mobile-friendly<span> </span></em><a href="https://themes.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shopify theme</em></a><em><span> </span>that makes checkout a breeze</em>. While that may be true, the fact is, most sales aren’t happening in browsers. They’re taking place within social media apps. </p>\n<p>Research firm eMarketer found that about<span> </span><a href="https://on.emarketer.com/rs/867-SLG-901/images/eMarketer-US%20Mobile%20Time%20Spent%202020%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">88% of the time</a><span> </span>mobile-users spend browsing the internet is done within social media apps, as opposed to mobile browsers. You might have a stunning ecommerce site, but without social commerce, you’re still missing out on the sales of users that won’t end up seeing it.</p>\n<p>Social commerce features are built by social media developers, engineered to function seamlessly and algorithmically designed to locate users that are more likely to have an interest in your product. </p>\n<p>Sales is complex, and nothing guarantees that users will buy from you, but it’s hard to envision any scenario where social commerce doesn’t give you a big advantage. </p>\n<h2 id="3">What are the best social commerce platforms for retailers?</h2>\n<p>With nearly every major social media platform investing in social commerce features, retailers have a lot of options when it comes to which tools they want to use to sell online.</p>\n<div class="responsive-video-wrapper gutter-bottom"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AU2Urhbp5sU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>\n<p>If you’re looking to get started selling through social commerce, here are the best platforms to explore: </p>\n<h3>1.

Users can browse products from their Shop tab, which displays products tuned to their previous purchases, search history, and likes, creating a personalized customer experience that aims to match your products with users most likely to purchase them.</p>\n<figure><img alt="facebook-shopping-products-for-you-section" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image6_a2d4e4dc-5c6c-4176-8a06-9a4f093b00a6.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544653" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image6_a2d4e4dc-5c6c-4176-8a06-9a4f093b00a6.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544653">\n<figcaption>Facebook recommends products from a variety of retailers to users based on their past shopping activity.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>You’ll even be able to communicate with customers directly through Facebook Messenger, giving you a unique opportunity to provide personalized customer support, and sell directly through instant messaging.</p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">\n<p><strong>💡TIP:</strong><span> </span>Products can be imported into your Facebook shop<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/facebook-instagram">directly from Shopify</a>. And since both Facebook and Instagram are owned by Meta Platforms, storefronts on both sites can be synced.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>2. Instagram</h3>\n<p>Instagram shopping features include dedicated storefronts, product tags that allow you to highlight items from your catalog within your posts or ads, and a Shop tab to optimize product discovery for users that might be interested. </p>\n<p>As with Facebook shops, users on Instagram shopping can browse products from a wide variety of stores directly from the Shop tab located on the bottom taskbar of the app. From there, they can access storefronts and product pages from a variety of brands. </p>\n<p>Brands and products are served to users based on their interests, follows, likes, and previous purchases⁠—meaning your products have a good chance of being shown to users who are actually interested in purchasing them.</p>\n<figure><img alt="instagram-shops-for-you-section" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image1_bbd5a5d8-5f8a-4726-b482-489e967643af.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544910" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image1_bbd5a5d8-5f8a-4726-b482-489e967643af.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544910">\n<figcaption>Instagram’s algorithm pairs users with shops they might be interested in.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Instagram is all about visual branding, so for business in industries like fashion or cosmetics, there’s a big opportunity to use visual flair to set yourself apart from your competitors. </p>\n<h3>3. Pinterest</h3>\n<p>If your<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/pinterest-marketing">Pinterest marketing</a><span> </span>strategy doesn’t include an element of social commerce, you’re likely missing out on a lot of sales. Social commerce may be an added convenience on other social media platforms, but on Pinterest, it’s a necessity. </p>\n<p>Pinterest is unique from every other social media platform in that a huge number of users log on for the purpose of shopping. In a<span> </span><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/why-facebook-provides-scale-but-instagram-and-pinterest-offer-relevance-for-social-commerce" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">survey from eMarketer</a>, 48% of respondents said their top social media activity on Pinterest was shopping, far exceeding the percentages for other social media platforms. </p>\n<p>That means that Pinterest has a uniquely high number of users willing to discover and purchase new products.

Choose the right social commerce channel for your product. </h3>\n<p>No single social media platform is best for every retailer, but if you want to know which is best for your business, consider the demographic makeup of your brand’s audience and start with the platform that most conforms to it. </p>\n<p>For example, if you’re mostly selling to Gen Z, you might consider using TikTok’s sales channels. If you’re selling to millennials, it might be better to start with Instagram.</p>\n<p>If you’re already using social media to advertise your products, consider which social channels drive the most engagement currently. Social commerce can increase the volume of sales with a more frictionless checkout, but the same instincts that cause more users to engage with your content will be used to drive sales of your product. </p>\n<p>While it’s possible to find audiences across multiple platforms, don’t fall into the trap of trying to do everything at once and spreading yourself too thin. Start by focusing on the most valuable social network, and plan to scale for the future. </p>\n<h3>2. Use your platform\'s livestreaming feature.</h3>\n<p>Livestreaming can be a great way to showcase your product and talk about the<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a><span> </span>offered by your brand over competitors. For<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/creator-economy">creators</a>, a livestream can be a great way to show off your personality and build a deeper connection with your followers. </p>\n<p>On a livestream, viewers can tune in, see your product in action, ask questions in real time, and get all the information they need to make a purchase. On Facebook, you can even enable<span> </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/880609949031868" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">live shopping</a>, which gives them the option to purchase directly from your stream while they watch. </p>\n<p>In a survey conducted by<span> </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1261488/share-internet-users-watching-buying-from-livestream-influencers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Statista</a>, 70% of US internet users that reported frequently watching livestreams also said they’re likely to buy products from livestreamers they follow. That means there’s a huge opportunity for creators and retailers to make sales via livestream. </p>\n<h3>3. Use instant messaging to engage with your customers. </h3>\n<p>When you’re selling online, it’s likely that customers are going to have questions about your products. You can’t be live streaming 24/7, but you can keep your instant messaging channels open for fast and easy communication.</p>\n<p>In a survey conducted by<span> </span><a href="https://99firms.com/blog/live-chat-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">99firms</a>, 73% of respondents said live chat was the “most satisfactory” form of communication from a company. Live chat helps add a personal touch to your sales process and is a fast and convenient way to provide customer support. </p>\n<p>Being there for customers this way helps build up a familiarity with your brand in their minds that will translate into stronger brand loyalty and more sales. By being available via chat, you help curb the number of users who abandon their purchases. </p>\n<p>Through private messaging, you can also offer discounts, promote new products, and nurture customer relationships following a purchase. The more personalized online shopping experience helps your customers feel more valued and lets them know you’re available to help. </p>\n<h3>4. Drive your growth by partnering with influencers. </h3>\n<p><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/influencer-marketing">Influencer marketing</a><span> </span>has continued growing in popularity as a method of driving sales, with the industry set to balloon to<span> </span><a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$16.4 billion in 2022</a>. Influencer audiences put a lot of value on the opinions of influencers they follow, so an endorsement can mean a huge boost to your online sales. </p>\n<p>On top of that, the level of social engagement on your posts tends to increase when you work with influencers, since they often have very engaged audiences. </p>\n<p>All that engagement plays well algorithmically too; when more users engage with your posts, there\'s a better chance of those posts being shown to new users who might be interested in your product. </p>\n<p>And you don’t necessarily need to work with particularly large influencers in order for influencer marketing to be advantageous. Micro-influencers<span> </span><a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/ebooks/influencer_marketing_benchmark_report_2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tend to have higher engagement rates</a><span> </span>than large influencers, which is more valuable for building a sustained, long-term engaged audience.</p>\n<center><form class="js-signup-inline marketing-form--inline" novalidate="novalidate" action="https://accounts.shopify.com//store-signup/setup" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post" __bizdiag="-495723452" __biza="W___"><span class="marketing-form__messages" id="MessageId_1571"></span></form></center>\n<h2>The future of ecommerce is social </h2>\n<p>Many ecommerce trends come and go, but social commerce won’t fade any time soon. As social media platforms develop more ways to incorporate social shopping, users will grow to expect a frictionless way to purchase products at the moment of discovery. </p>\n<p>For small businesses, social commerce offers a level of access to customers that lets them compete on a level playing field with large ones. Experimenting with social commerce strategies now can put you in a position to scale down the road.</p>',

          '<meta charset="utf-8">\n<p>Looking to reach large audiences in your target demographic? For ecommerce businesses, there are few resources more valuable than social media. More than half of the world’s population uses social media, with a majority of us logging in at least once a day. </p>\n<p>With numbers like these, social media marketing has massive ROI potential, but driving sales on social media still comes with its challenges⁠—one being getting your followers to<span> </span><em>leave</em><span> </span>a social media app to make a purchase on your online store. </p>\n<p>However, this might not be such a big challenge anymore, thanks to a fast-growing ecommerce trend: social commerce.</p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">\n<h4>Table of Contents</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-commerce#1">What is social commerce?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-commerce#2">What are the benefits of social commerce?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-commerce#3">What are the best social commerce platforms for retailers?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-commerce#4">How to sell using social commerce: Tips and best practices</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id="1">What is social commerce?</h2>\n<p>Social commerce (sometimes called social shopping) exists at the cross section of ecommerce and social media. In basic terms, social commerce is when businesses, brands, and creators sell on sales channels located directly on their social media profiles or their followers’ social media feeds. </p>\n<p>In the past couple of years, social media platforms have developed tools like shoppable posts, on-site storefronts, and dedicated checkouts that allow users to discover new products, explore new brands, and make purchases—all without ever leaving their social network. </p>\n<p>While the practice is still evolving, one thing is certain; social commerce is incredibly profitable. According to<span> </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1231944/social-commerce-global-market-size/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Statista</a>, social commerce generated about $475 billion in revenue in 2020, and is expected to grow at a rate of 28.4% annually, reaching $3.37 trillion by 2028. </p>\n<p>Insight into why social commerce is so profitable can be traced all the way back to 2005, when<span> </span><a href="https://genuinevc.com/2005/12/06/the-beginnings-of-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the term was first coined</a><span> </span>by David Beisel, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a product is directly integrated into becoming content itself, it bypasses the normal filter that consumers put up to ignore or at least be skeptical of the advertising. And when this advertorial content is generated by a friend, a special element of trust is integrated into the advertorial relationship that wasn’t present otherwise.</p>\n<footer><cite>David Beisel, Co-Founder and Partner at<span> </span><a href="https://nextview.vc/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NextView Ventures</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it all boils down to trust.</p>\n<p>Long before Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram⁠—when Facebook was still in its infancy and the term “social commerce” characterized group-buying sites like Groupon and LivingSocial, Beisal understood the potential behind the symbiosis of ecommerce and social media.</p>\n<h2 id="2">What are the benefits of social commerce?</h2>\n<p>By meeting your target audience on their own turf, social commerce offers many advantages over traditional ecommerce. If it isn’t already a part of your<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-media-marketing-strategy">social media marketing strategy</a>, here’s why it should be: </p>\n<h3>1. Less friction in the checkout process.</h3>\n<p>In traditional ecommerce, social media is used to redirect traffic to an ecommerce site where users can purchase. While this model can work, the biggest deterrent is the friction it creates in the buying process. </p>\n<p>Following through on a purchase requires users to stop what they’re doing on social media, go to an external site, and then return to where they left off. This process might not seem arduous, but the effort involved is just arduous enough for many users to avoid. </p>\n<p>These additional steps required to make a purchase are what we’re talking about when we refer to friction in the checkout process. Each step makes purchasing a little more complicated, and at each step, users have a chance to decide the process is no longer worth it. </p>\n<p>But when you use social commerce tools within a social media platform, you greatly reduce that friction. Users that stumble on your content already have everything they need right in front of them to make a purchase. Purchasing from you is almost as effortless as tapping Like or Follow.</p>\n<figure><img alt="vessi-facebook-ad-with-shop-now-button" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image4_4467d23f-8e36-4279-81bc-85e76d41a1f7.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647543921" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image4_4467d23f-8e36-4279-81bc-85e76d41a1f7.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647543921">\n<figcaption>Facebook’s Shop Now button reduces friction by allowing users to browse products directly from their Facebook feeds.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Potential customers will still make a lot of considerations before purchasing from you, but when they’re able to buy directly from the point of discovery, the effort involved in the purchase won’t be one of them.</p>\n<h3>2. Drive social media engagement while you sell. </h3>\n<p>A good social media<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/marketing-plan">marketing plan</a><span> </span>needs to perform the simultaneous functions of finding new audiences and maintaining good relationships with existing ones. </p>\n<p>When you use social commerce, you can engage with these two audiences simultaneously. Posts driven to create brand awareness can also feature buying options for others who are in the consideration phase.</p>\n<figure><img alt="spruce-toronto-tagged-products-on-group-post" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image2_a7ce2e53-910a-4f23-9f05-35e3cc3f10cc.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544173" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image2_a7ce2e53-910a-4f23-9f05-35e3cc3f10cc.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544173">\n<figcaption>Via<span> </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SpruceToronto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Spruce Toronto</a>. In this post, Spruce has tagged its products in a post shared with a neighborhood group for Cabbagetown, Toronto.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>A bonus feature of this dynamic is the users who may fall down the<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a><span> </span>a little faster than usual. With awareness, consideration, and conversion all happening in the same place, users who’ve just discovered your brand may have all the info they need to decide your product is worth buying, and the features they need to buy it. </p>\n<h3>3. The social commerce market is huge.</h3>\n<p>Grouping social media users by their follows, likes, or interests makes finding your<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/target-market">target market</a><span> </span>a breeze. But if you’re doing this<span> </span><em>without</em><span> </span>social commerce features, you’re likely missing out on a lot of potential sales. </p>\n<p>The number of people who report having purchased via social commerce has been<span> </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1120128/number-social-buyers-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">growing since 2019</a>. As users warm up to social shopping, this trend is expected to continue. By 2025, it’s estimated that around 37% of Americans will have made a purchase through social media.</p>\n<p>With more businesses adopting social commerce, the ability to buy directly on social media will become less of an extravagance and more an expectation. Adopting social commerce now will put you in prime position to stay on top of this trend and stop missing out on lost sales.</p>\n<h3>4. Generate social proof while you sell. </h3>\n<p><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/social-proof">Social proof</a><span> </span>is a psychological phenomenon that describes our tendency to rely on the opinion of others when making purchase decisions. </p>\n<p>In ecommerce, social proof can take the form of product reviews,<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/customer-testimonials">customer testimonials</a>, case studies, public praise, or even just knowledge of a product’s popularity. If you’ve ever watched a movie or TV show just because everyone seems to be talking about it, you’ve experienced the power of social proof. </p>\n<p>Social media is a first-touch point for a lot of users, which makes highly visible social proof a valuable tool for picking up followers and building an audience. When you sell via social commerce, that social proof also becomes a valuable tool for picking up sales. </p>\n<p>Encourage purchasers to share pics or videos of your product. Ask for reviews or endorsements from influencers with highly engaged audiences. Just seeing that users are enjoying your product will help encourage others to do the same.</p>\n<figure><img alt="wunderkids-canada-post-featuring-customer-with-products" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image3_fc866812-b693-451d-8bf2-580ecedefe0e.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544385" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image3_fc866812-b693-451d-8bf2-580ecedefe0e.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544385">\n<figcaption>Via<span> </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/wunderkids.ca/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wunderkids Canada</a>. Here, Wunderkids generates social proof by sharing an Instagram post from one of its followers that features its product.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>One top of this, your social shopping posts themselves act as a type of social proof. When online shoppers see their peers liking, commenting, and sharing your posts, they’ll feel more confident in making the decision to buy your product. </p>\n<h3>5. Easily accommodate the growing number of mobile shoppers.</h3>\n<p>The number of<span> </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-commerce-shopping-trends-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">mobile ecommerce sales</a><span> </span>reached $359 billion in 2021, a 15.2% increase from 2020. Industry experts estimate that by 2025, mobile ecommerce sales will account for 44.2% of retail ecommerce sales in the US, for a grand total of $728.28 billion. </p>\n<p>As online shoppers warm up to the idea of shopping on their mobile devices, and social media networks adopt more tools that help facilitate it, an easy-to-use mobile-ready storefront will become more and more crucial to the success of any online retailer. </p>\n<p>You might be thinking,<span> </span><em>So what? I have a responsive, mobile-friendly<span> </span></em><a href="https://themes.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shopify theme</em></a><em><span> </span>that makes checkout a breeze</em>.

Users can browse products from their Shop tab, which displays products tuned to their previous purchases, search history, and likes, creating a personalized customer experience that aims to match your products with users most likely to purchase them.</p>\n<figure><img alt="facebook-shopping-products-for-you-section" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image6_a2d4e4dc-5c6c-4176-8a06-9a4f093b00a6.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544653" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image6_a2d4e4dc-5c6c-4176-8a06-9a4f093b00a6.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544653">\n<figcaption>Facebook recommends products from a variety of retailers to users based on their past shopping activity.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>You’ll even be able to communicate with customers directly through Facebook Messenger, giving you a unique opportunity to provide personalized customer support, and sell directly through instant messaging.</p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">\n<p><strong>💡TIP:</strong><span> </span>Products can be imported into your Facebook shop<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/facebook-instagram">directly from Shopify</a>. And since both Facebook and Instagram are owned by Meta Platforms, storefronts on both sites can be synced.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>2. Instagram</h3>\n<p>Instagram shopping features include dedicated storefronts, product tags that allow you to highlight items from your catalog within your posts or ads, and a Shop tab to optimize product discovery for users that might be interested. </p>\n<p>As with Facebook shops, users on Instagram shopping can browse products from a wide variety of stores directly from the Shop tab located on the bottom taskbar of the app. From there, they can access storefronts and product pages from a variety of brands. </p>\n<p>Brands and products are served to users based on their interests, follows, likes, and previous purchases⁠—meaning your products have a good chance of being shown to users who are actually interested in purchasing them.</p>\n<figure><img alt="instagram-shops-for-you-section" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image1_bbd5a5d8-5f8a-4726-b482-489e967643af.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544910" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image1_bbd5a5d8-5f8a-4726-b482-489e967643af.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647544910">\n<figcaption>Instagram’s algorithm pairs users with shops they might be interested in.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Instagram is all about visual branding, so for business in industries like fashion or cosmetics, there’s a big opportunity to use visual flair to set yourself apart from your competitors. </p>\n<h3>3. Pinterest</h3>\n<p>If your<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/pinterest-marketing">Pinterest marketing</a><span> </span>strategy doesn’t include an element of social commerce, you’re likely missing out on a lot of sales. Social commerce may be an added convenience on other social media platforms, but on Pinterest, it’s a necessity. </p>\n<p>Pinterest is unique from every other social media platform in that a huge number of users log on for the purpose of shopping. In a<span> </span><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/why-facebook-provides-scale-but-instagram-and-pinterest-offer-relevance-for-social-commerce" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">survey from eMarketer</a>, 48% of respondents said their top social media activity on Pinterest was shopping, far exceeding the percentages for other social media platforms. </p>\n<p>That means that Pinterest has a uniquely high number of users willing to discover and purchase new products. Fashion and home décor products are especially popular on Pinterest, so if you’re in these industries, a good Pinterest sales plan is a must. </p>\n<p>Users are able to find and save products they’re interested in, so even when customers don’t purchase right away, it’s easy to come back to your products and purchase later.</p>\n<p>Brands selling on Pinterest can also use buyable pins, which act as a Buy button that’s embedded directly in your product images, giving users a quick and easy way to add your product to their cart.</p>\n<figure><img alt="pinterest-fashion-post-with-products-tagged" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image5_c96b3f7c-53b5-4b35-ae89-3f0d208f4a21.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647545035" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image5_c96b3f7c-53b5-4b35-ae89-3f0d208f4a21.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647545035">\n<figcaption>Brands selling on Pinterest can add buyable pins to their posts, giving users a quick and easy way to add your product to their cart.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Plus, buyable pins are synced to products in your Shopify store and automatically update when pricing or stock information changes. </p>\n<p>As your products start to pick up on engagement and get more repins, clicks, and purchases, Pinterest may add a “Best-seller” label to the product, which helps its visibility in “Popular” exploration pages.</p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded">\n<p><strong>💡TIP:</strong><span> </span>Add the<span> </span><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/pinterest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest app</a><span> </span>to your online store to begin using Pinterest’s buyable pins.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>4.

Choose the right social commerce channel for your product. </h3>\n<p>No single social media platform is best for every retailer, but if you want to know which is best for your business, consider the demographic makeup of your brand’s audience and start with the platform that most conforms to it. </p>\n<p>For example, if you’re mostly selling to Gen Z, you might consider using TikTok’s sales channels. If you’re selling to millennials, it might be better to start with Instagram.</p>\n<p>If you’re already using social media to advertise your products, consider which social channels drive the most engagement currently. Social commerce can increase the volume of sales with a more frictionless checkout, but the same instincts that cause more users to engage with your content will be used to drive sales of your product. </p>\n<p>While it’s possible to find audiences across multiple platforms, don’t fall into the trap of trying to do everything at once and spreading yourself too thin. Start by focusing on the most valuable social network, and plan to scale for the future. </p>\n<h3>2. Use your platform\'s livestreaming feature.</h3>\n<p>Livestreaming can be a great way to showcase your product and talk about the<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a><span> </span>offered by your brand over competitors. For<span> </span><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/creator-economy">creators</a>, a livestream can be a great way to show off your personality and build a deeper connection with your followers. </p>\n<p>On a livestream, viewers can tune in, see your product in action, ask questions in real time, and get all the information they need to make a purchase. On Facebook, you can even enable<span> </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/880609949031868" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">live shopping</a>, which gives them the option to purchase directly from your stream while they watch. </p>\n<p>In a survey conducted by<span> </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1261488/share-internet-users-watching-buying-from-livestream-influencers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Statista</a>, 70% of US internet users that reported frequently watching livestreams also said they’re likely to buy products from livestreamers they follow. That means there’s a huge opportunity for creators and retailers to make sales via livestream. </p>\n<h3>3. Use instant messaging to engage with your customers. </h3>\n<p>When you’re selling online, it’s likely that customers are going to have questions about your products. You can’t be live streaming 24/7, but you can keep your instant messaging channels open for fast and easy communication.</p>\n<p>In a survey conducted by<span> </span><a href="https://99firms.com/blog/live-chat-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">99firms</a>, 73% of respondents said live chat was the “most satisfactory” form of communication from a company. Live chat helps add a personal touch to your sales process and is a fast and convenient way to provide customer support. </p>\n<p>Being there for customers this way helps build up a familiarity with your brand in their minds that will translate into stronger brand loyalty and more sales. By being available via chat, you help curb the number of users who abandon their purchases. </p>\n<p>Through private messaging, you can also offer discounts, promote new products, and nurture customer relationships following a purchase. The more personalized online shopping experience helps your customers feel more valued and lets them know you’re available to help. </p>\n<h3>4. Drive your growth by partnering with influencers. </h3>\n<p><a href="https://en.shopify.hk/blog/influencer-marketing">Influencer marketing</a><span> </span>has continued growing in popularity as a method of driving sales, with the industry set to balloon to<span> </span><a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$16.4 billion in 2022</a>. Influencer audiences put a lot of value on the opinions of influencers they follow, so an endorsement can mean a huge boost to your online sales. </p>\n<p>On top of that, the level of social engagement on your posts tends to increase when you work with influencers, since they often have very engaged audiences. </p>\n<p>All that engagement plays well algorithmically too; when more users engage with your posts, there\'s a better chance of those posts being shown to new users who might be interested in your product. </p>\n<p>And you don’t necessarily need to work with particularly large influencers in order for influencer marketing to be advantageous. Micro-influencers<span> </span><a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/ebooks/influencer_marketing_benchmark_report_2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tend to have higher engagement rates</a><span> </span>than large influencers, which is more valuable for building a sustained, long-term engaged audience.</p>\n<center><form class="js-signup-inline marketing-form--inline" novalidate="novalidate" action="https://accounts.shopify.com//store-signup/setup" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post" __bizdiag="-495723452" __biza="W___"><span class="marketing-form__messages" id="MessageId_1571"></span></form></center>\n<h2>The future of ecommerce is social </h2>\n<p>Many ecommerce trends come and go, but social commerce won’t fade any time soon. As social media platforms develop more ways to incorporate social shopping, users will grow to expect a frictionless way to purchase products at the moment of discovery. </p>\n<p>For small businesses, social commerce offers a level of access to customers that lets them compete on a level playing field with large ones. Experimenting with social commerce strategies now can put you in a position to scale down the road.</p>',

          '<meta charset="utf-8">\n<p>“How do you spell entrepreneur?”</p>\n<p>Brianna Dotson asked her teacher this question in grade three. She and her twin sister Corianna had a sense even then that they would change the world someday. And they were right—they launched their eyewear brand<span> </span><a href="https://cocoandbreezy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coco and Breezy</a><span> </span>when they were only 19, and have been building successful businesses ever since. But that’s the short version of the story. Here’s how it all really happened.</p>\n<p>Corianna and Brianna became Coco and Breezy when they were newborns, nicknames coined by their parents that have stuck ever since. But growing up in the suburbs of Apple Valley, Minnesota, other kids taunted them for having “ghetto” names. Being the only two kids of color in their school, they were bullied for being different.</p>\n<p>So they channeled that anger into creative expression, turning to DIY projects. They discovered a fashion show in their state and decided to enter, customizing their clothes with a sewing machine to create a collection for the local runway. The clothes turned out great—but they needed accessories. And the household item they found for those accessories would change their lives forever.</p>\n<p>Safety glasses. </p>\n<p>The kind you’d wear to protect your eyes in a workshop, the big ones. They found a pair sitting around and decorated them with studs from a belt, chains, and gemstones. At the fashion show, those glasses were the star of the show. And, turns out, their custom eyewear was far more powerful than the compliments alone.</p>\n<p>“When we started wearing them, they made us feel so empowered,” Coco says in an interview in their sixth-floor Manhattan eyewear showroom, sipping an oat milk matcha latte on a green velvet couch in front of a peachy wall proudly bearing their namesakes, Coco and Breezy.</p>\n<p><img alt="a candid image of Coco and Breezy sitting on a green suede sofa, laughing " data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/coco-and-breezy-on-couch-laughing.jpg?v=1647491669" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/coco-and-breezy-on-couch-laughing.jpg?v=1647491669"></p>\n<p>“It felt like, ‘this is a level of confidence we’ve never had because now we don’t have to stare at the people who are staring at us.’ It was a shield of protection,” Coco says. “When we put them on, you couldn’t tell us nothing. We were on our own planet.”</p>\n<h2>Cha-ching: Making their first sales</h2>\n<p>Coco and Breezy found other ways to escape their small town, too. They launched a MySpace page when they were 17 and grew an audience of more than 50,000 people to whom they’d share videos of themselves working three jobs each, 80-90 hours per week. “We’re going to move to New York one day,” they told their followers, wearing their signature glasses.</p>\n<p>(The reason for those long work hours: the twins have been financially independent since age 15 when their father fell ill and was unable to work. That’s when the girls began to contribute financially to their household. “Our parents supported us creatively and with love, but they couldn’t necessarily support us financially,” Breezy says.)</p>\n<p>It wasn’t only their jobs that earned them money. The twins quickly learned that their MySpace audience wanted those glasses. And so Coco figured out how to add PayPal to their page, selling their glasses for $200 each. This was back in 2005, when most people didn’t even know what ecommerce<span> </span><em>was</em><span> </span>yet. But these small-town teenagers knew how to monetize their skills from the start. Coco and Breezy were influencers before there were influencers.</p>\n<p>“Once we got some traction and people were loving what we were wearing, we were like, bingo. This is the business,” says Breezy of those fated safety glasses.</p>\n<p>That “bingo” moment finally led them to New York City in 2009 when they were 19. Like so many before them, they moved to pursue their dreams even if it meant living in a small, three-bedroom Bushwick apartment they shared with four others, two to a room. Coco and Breezy’s room had no windows; it was meant to be a closet; they slept on an air mattress. They each had $500 to contribute to their new eyewear company, the office of which was in their kitchen.</p>\n<p><img alt="an image of Coco and Breezy posing on a busy street wearing sunglasses and leather jackets" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/coco-and-breezy-street-leathers.jpg?v=1647492220" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/coco-and-breezy-street-leathers.jpg?v=1647492220"></p>\n<p>“But guess who were the happiest girls alive?” Coco says. “Us. Cause we were there in freakin’ New York. That’s all that matters. An important part of entrepreneurship is that you have to understand it’s a process. You have to appreciate all those moments, you have to appreciate every stepping stone.”</p>\n<blockquote>"An important part of entrepreneurship is that you have to understand it’s a process. You have to appreciate all those moments, you have to appreciate every stepping stone.”</blockquote>\n<p>And it wasn’t long before things took off. Pop artist Ashanti chose to wear Coco and Breezy to the Hip Hop Honors Awards, followed closely by Kelly Osbourne on Good Morning America and Dancing With the Stars. This was only weeks after moving to New York. Soon after, Prince asked them to design three-lensed glasses to, you know, cover his third eye, a request that led to an iconic Coco and Breezy product and a bond between them all for the rest of Prince’s life.</p>\n<p>“It was so affirmative to be like, ‘Wow. We’re doing something,’” Breezy recalls.</p>\n<p><img alt="an image of the entrepreneur standing on the counter in front of a wall of sunglasses, placing a product on the shelf" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image1_38c7996b-dc81-41c3-ac39-03320acef47a.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647492343" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image1_38c7996b-dc81-41c3-ac39-03320acef47a.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647492343"></p>\n<h2>Making ends meet as entrepreneurs</h2>\n<p>Every entrepreneur knows that success is an intangible recipe of varying ingredients often including luck, skill, and timing. Coco and Breezy believe something more spiritual is at play too.</p>\n<p>In their earliest days in New York City, when they weren’t sure how they would pay rent, they’d be walking down the street and someone would say, “I love your glasses! How much?” From these impromptu sidewalk encounters, the sisters made their first in-person sales—and secured their first six months of rent.</p>\n<p>Some would call this luck. Breezy calls those early purchasers guardian angels, helping them survive in their hardest financial times, paying for their father’s care and bills while supporting themselves in a city unkind to sparse wallets. This guardian angel belief returned at another pinnacle moment of their careers, when they decided that their eyewear company alone would not define them as entrepreneurs. </p>\n<p>There would be music in their lives too.</p>\n<h2>Starting a second business</h2>\n<p>Music has always played a special role in Coco and Breezy’s lives. Their Puerto Rican mom would play the congas at family events while others chimed in with whatever instruments they could find, the percussion punctuating their celebrations. Their parents listened to R&amp;B, blues, a little bit of everything and the girls grew up dancing to all of it. Music was something they turned to in good times and bad.</p>\n<blockquote>"We would have little dance parties when we were working from home in our little-ass apartment, we’d just tear it up in the kitchen real quick."</blockquote>\n<p>“That’s how I would get out of times when I would feel down about an entrepreneur thing. I would just throw on a song,” says Breezy. “And we would have little dance parties when we were working from home in our little-ass apartment, we’d just tear it up in the kitchen real quick.”</p>\n<p>This love of music grew into a passion for DJing. Both Coco and Breezy knew they wanted to branch out here, but were mindful that they needed to build a strong foundation with their eyewear brand first.</p>\n<p>“I knew we could do multiple things, but it’s challenging to put only 40% of yourself into something that’s not 100% yet,” Coco says. So they built their eyewear empire sale by sale, graduating from their kitchen to a showroom—the first time they’d ever entered a corporate office; the first in their family line to start a business like this. Their father grew up during segregation, their grandmother picked cotton in the fields. But Coco and Breezy reported to no one but themselves, breaking the “generational curses,” as they put it. </p>\n<p><img alt="an image of Coco and Breezy posing in leather jackets, backdropped by large palm plants" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image7_d9f9d61d-21cf-438a-9689-20bf45d38c7e.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647492421" class="lazyload"></p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, they dreamt of becoming DJs. And then one day, an email arrived. </p>\n<p>“I want Coco and Breezy to DJ,” it read. Which was strange, says Coco, because “there was nothing about us having an interest in DJing on the internet. That was something we kept to ourselves. So we were like, ‘Let’s do it. It’s our time now.’”</p>\n<p>They called up their DJ friend Martina McFlyy for a crash course in DJing, performed their first gig, and started learning how to be real DJs every spare moment they had.

I put my heart and soul into all of this.”</p>\n<p><img alt="An image of Coco and Breezy on the street, attention focused on a phone" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image3_eb5bd975-9e33-470c-aafa-8515d3c9a7a2.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647492642" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image3_eb5bd975-9e33-470c-aafa-8515d3c9a7a2.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647492642"></p>\n<p>They’ve learned how to divide their time between their ventures.</p>\n<p>“The number one skill you have to have when you are multifaceted and have multiple businesses is understanding how to delegate and knowing how to articulate what you want,” Breezy says.</p>\n<blockquote>"The number one skill you have to have when you are multifaceted and have multiple businesses is understanding how to delegate and knowing how to articulate what you want."</blockquote>\n<p>Since you can’t do it all yourself, you need to learn to verbalize exactly what you need so that your team can execute it for you.</p>\n<p>“You need to put your ego down,” she says. “A lot of times people want to be the best at everything, but that’s impossible.”</p>\n<h2>Claiming the title of “entrepreneur”</h2>\n<p>Many business owners don’t identify with the term “entrepreneur.” Coco and Breezy, on the other hand, have been claiming the title ever since they learned the word.</p>\n<p>“We’re snatching it up,” Breezy says. “We’re just as important as the people in Silicon Valley. When we were younger, we didn’t have Black women that looked like us, with natural hair and piercings, with tattoos who wore leather to work, and it’s important. It’s our duty to show that entrepreneurship isn’t just a certain type of way. </p>\n<p>“That way, other young Black girls that are looking at entrepreneurs, they can look at us and see themselves in somebody and be like, ‘Oh wait, she’s wearing her Afro? She has piercings and tattoos? I can be an entrepreneur?’ It’s not just a white man in a suit.”</p>\n<p>And so they both proudly claim the title of<span> </span><em>entrepreneur</em>, to show that there is no single way to be one.</p>\n<p>So what other passions are the twins yet to pursue?</p>\n<p>“It’s my dream to be a superhero in a movie,” Breezy says, and Coco agrees, their knees brushing against one another on the green couch, never interrupting each other, each giving the other time to speak, not completing each other’s sentences as the twin cliché would dictate. They’ve previously mentioned that they believe someday, someone will write a book about them, and it will turn into a movie. </p>\n<p>“Or a cartoon character that models the story behind our story,” Breezy adds. “There’s not a lot of inspiring cartoons you see of young Black girls that don’t make a mockery of our culture. You don’t see a Black girl running a company. And so I think I’m going to manifest it. Some young Black twins who wanted to start a business, who didn’t come from a lot. Who started a billion dollar company, who were the biggest DJs—I’m manifesting my life and it’s going to be able to inspire other young kids.”</p>\n<p>If what Coco and Breezy have already been able to manifest are any indication, that cartoon will be soon coming to a screen near you. </p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--blue marketing-block--padded">\n<p><strong>Coco and Breezy’s financial advice: Buy property</strong></p>\n<p>“As black women, it’s important for us to own property, because we’ve been deprived of home ownership,” Coco says. </p>\n<p>Even if it’s not financially possible on your own, band together with friends and invest together. That’s what Coco and Breezy did with two partners. Their property in the Catskills includes five houses, and they’ve now expanded to a property in the Adirondacks as well. </p>\n<p>Where did the money come from to purchase the land?</p>\n<p>“We do a lot of influencer work,” Coco says. “That’s easy, big money. We did a Pandora campaign, and a Tommy Hilfiger campaign, maybe one more, and we acted like we didn’t see that money. We just put that towards buying our first property, instead of buying designer.</p>\n<p>“I want to tell all the young people that are making influencer money: save your money and buy property or invest it in something. Don’t spend all your money on material things.”</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Coco’s advice for entrepreneurs</strong></p>\n<p>“One thing I’ve learned is that to be a CEO, you don’t need to know everything. And I think that’s often what stops people from starting companies, because they feel like, ‘Oh my gosh, if I want to be a CEO or founder, I need to know everything.’</p>\n<p>“But guess what? You’re the person with the big ideas. You’re the person that’s driving and leading your team. You’re the person who’s going to do the research for what you don’t know. (Entrepreneur) Ben Horwitz taught me that, and it changed my whole life.</p>\n<p>“I don’t need to know everything. I will be open-minded to learn what I don’t know. But I’m not going to stop myself because I feel insecure about walking into a room not knowing certain things.”</p>\n<p><strong>Breezy’s advice for entrepreneurs</strong></p>\n<p>“Starting a company and being an entrepreneur isn’t for everybody. And failure is okay. You have to try something out before you assume it will or won’t work. I think a lot of times as entrepreneurs and creators, we get so stuck on this one idea, and it’s okay to have a vision, but it’s also okay to have a little wiggle room and be able to pivot. As long as it’s coming from the heart, and that pivot is going to be true to yourself.”</p>\n<p><strong>Finding their unique identities</strong></p>\n<p>Getting bullied growing up, Coco and Breezy became inseparable—they were often each other’s only friend. And that showed up when they started their business too: they shared an email address, would answer emails together, would walk to the mail together to ship a package.</p>\n<p>But they realized they weren’t going to grow if they were both doing the same things. So they took a hard look at themselves. Who was Corianna? Who was Brianna? Not Coco and Breezy; that part was easy. But who were they individually? That led to Breezy identifying as the creative rock-star risk-taker who leads design, and Coco as the self-proclaimed “mom” who focuses on marketing and operational growth.</p>\n<p>Now that the two realize how different they are, it’s much easier to divide and conquer.</p>\n<p>“Our duality together works great because we’re different,” Coco says. “We’re like the ying and the yang.”</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>This piece originally appeared in the print edition of </em><a href="https://magazine.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shopify Magazine</em></a><em>.

          '<meta charset="utf-8">\n<p>“How do you spell entrepreneur?”</p>\n<p>Brianna Dotson asked her teacher this question in grade three. She and her twin sister Corianna had a sense even then that they would change the world someday. And they were right—they launched their eyewear brand<span> </span><a href="https://cocoandbreezy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coco and Breezy</a><span> </span>when they were only 19, and have been building successful businesses ever since. But that’s the short version of the story. Here’s how it all really happened.</p>\n<p>Corianna and Brianna became Coco and Breezy when they were newborns, nicknames coined by their parents that have stuck ever since. But growing up in the suburbs of Apple Valley, Minnesota, other kids taunted them for having “ghetto” names. Being the only two kids of color in their school, they were bullied for being different.</p>\n<p>So they channeled that anger into creative expression, turning to DIY projects. They discovered a fashion show in their state and decided to enter, customizing their clothes with a sewing machine to create a collection for the local runway. The clothes turned out great—but they needed accessories. And the household item they found for those accessories would change their lives forever.</p>\n<p>Safety glasses. </p>\n<p>The kind you’d wear to protect your eyes in a workshop, the big ones. They found a pair sitting around and decorated them with studs from a belt, chains, and gemstones. At the fashion show, those glasses were the star of the show. And, turns out, their custom eyewear was far more powerful than the compliments alone.</p>\n<p>“When we started wearing them, they made us feel so empowered,” Coco says in an interview in their sixth-floor Manhattan eyewear showroom, sipping an oat milk matcha latte on a green velvet couch in front of a peachy wall proudly bearing their namesakes, Coco and Breezy.</p>\n<p><img alt="a candid image of Coco and Breezy sitting on a green suede sofa, laughing " data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/coco-and-breezy-on-couch-laughing.jpg?v=1647491669" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/coco-and-breezy-on-couch-laughing.jpg?v=1647491669"></p>\n<p>“It felt like, ‘this is a level of confidence we’ve never had because now we don’t have to stare at the people who are staring at us.’ It was a shield of protection,” Coco says. “When we put them on, you couldn’t tell us nothing. We were on our own planet.”</p>\n<h2>Cha-ching: Making their first sales</h2>\n<p>Coco and Breezy found other ways to escape their small town, too. They launched a MySpace page when they were 17 and grew an audience of more than 50,000 people to whom they’d share videos of themselves working three jobs each, 80-90 hours per week. “We’re going to move to New York one day,” they told their followers, wearing their signature glasses.</p>\n<p>(The reason for those long work hours: the twins have been financially independent since age 15 when their father fell ill and was unable to work. That’s when the girls began to contribute financially to their household. “Our parents supported us creatively and with love, but they couldn’t necessarily support us financially,” Breezy says.)</p>\n<p>It wasn’t only their jobs that earned them money. The twins quickly learned that their MySpace audience wanted those glasses. And so Coco figured out how to add PayPal to their page, selling their glasses for $200 each. This was back in 2005, when most people didn’t even know what ecommerce<span> </span><em>was</em><span> </span>yet. But these small-town teenagers knew how to monetize their skills from the start. Coco and Breezy were influencers before there were influencers.</p>\n<p>“Once we got some traction and people were loving what we were wearing, we were like, bingo. This is the business,” says Breezy of those fated safety glasses.</p>\n<p>That “bingo” moment finally led them to New York City in 2009 when they were 19. Like so many before them, they moved to pursue their dreams even if it meant living in a small, three-bedroom Bushwick apartment they shared with four others, two to a room. Coco and Breezy’s room had no windows; it was meant to be a closet; they slept on an air mattress. They each had $500 to contribute to their new eyewear company, the office of which was in their kitchen.</p>\n<p><img alt="an image of Coco and Breezy posing on a busy street wearing sunglasses and leather jackets" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/coco-and-breezy-street-leathers.jpg?v=1647492220" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/coco-and-breezy-street-leathers.jpg?v=1647492220"></p>\n<p>“But guess who were the happiest girls alive?” Coco says. “Us. Cause we were there in freakin’ New York. That’s all that matters. An important part of entrepreneurship is that you have to understand it’s a process. You have to appreciate all those moments, you have to appreciate every stepping stone.”</p>\n<blockquote>"An important part of entrepreneurship is that you have to understand it’s a process. You have to appreciate all those moments, you have to appreciate every stepping stone.”</blockquote>\n<p>And it wasn’t long before things took off. Pop artist Ashanti chose to wear Coco and Breezy to the Hip Hop Honors Awards, followed closely by Kelly Osbourne on Good Morning America and Dancing With the Stars. This was only weeks after moving to New York. Soon after, Prince asked them to design three-lensed glasses to, you know, cover his third eye, a request that led to an iconic Coco and Breezy product and a bond between them all for the rest of Prince’s life.</p>\n<p>“It was so affirmative to be like, ‘Wow. We’re doing something,’” Breezy recalls.</p>\n<p><img alt="an image of the entrepreneur standing on the counter in front of a wall of sunglasses, placing a product on the shelf" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image1_38c7996b-dc81-41c3-ac39-03320acef47a.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647492343" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image1_38c7996b-dc81-41c3-ac39-03320acef47a.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647492343"></p>\n<h2>Making ends meet as entrepreneurs</h2>\n<p>Every entrepreneur knows that success is an intangible recipe of varying ingredients often including luck, skill, and timing. Coco and Breezy believe something more spiritual is at play too.</p>\n<p>In their earliest days in New York City, when they weren’t sure how they would pay rent, they’d be walking down the street and someone would say, “I love your glasses! How much?” From these impromptu sidewalk encounters, the sisters made their first in-person sales—and secured their first six months of rent.</p>\n<p>Some would call this luck. Breezy calls those early purchasers guardian angels, helping them survive in their hardest financial times, paying for their father’s care and bills while supporting themselves in a city unkind to sparse wallets. This guardian angel belief returned at another pinnacle moment of their careers, when they decided that their eyewear company alone would not define them as entrepreneurs. </p>\n<p>There would be music in their lives too.</p>\n<h2>Starting a second business</h2>\n<p>Music has always played a special role in Coco and Breezy’s lives. Their Puerto Rican mom would play the congas at family events while others chimed in with whatever instruments they could find, the percussion punctuating their celebrations. Their parents listened to R&amp;B, blues, a little bit of everything and the girls grew up dancing to all of it. Music was something they turned to in good times and bad.</p>\n<blockquote>"We would have little dance parties when we were working from home in our little-ass apartment, we’d just tear it up in the kitchen real quick."</blockquote>\n<p>“That’s how I would get out of times when I would feel down about an entrepreneur thing. I would just throw on a song,” says Breezy. “And we would have little dance parties when we were working from home in our little-ass apartment, we’d just tear it up in the kitchen real quick.”</p>\n<p>This love of music grew into a passion for DJing. Both Coco and Breezy knew they wanted to branch out here, but were mindful that they needed to build a strong foundation with their eyewear brand first.</p>\n<p>“I knew we could do multiple things, but it’s challenging to put only 40% of yourself into something that’s not 100% yet,” Coco says. So they built their eyewear empire sale by sale, graduating from their kitchen to a showroom—the first time they’d ever entered a corporate office; the first in their family line to start a business like this. Their father grew up during segregation, their grandmother picked cotton in the fields. But Coco and Breezy reported to no one but themselves, breaking the “generational curses,” as they put it. </p>\n<p><img alt="an image of Coco and Breezy posing in leather jackets, backdropped by large palm plants" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image7_d9f9d61d-21cf-438a-9689-20bf45d38c7e.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647492421" class="lazyload"></p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, they dreamt of becoming DJs. And then one day, an email arrived. </p>\n<p>“I want Coco and Breezy to DJ,” it read. Which was strange, says Coco, because “there was nothing about us having an interest in DJing on the internet. That was something we kept to ourselves. So we were like, ‘Let’s do it. It’s our time now.’”</p>\n<p>They called up their DJ friend Martina McFlyy for a crash course in DJing, performed their first gig, and started learning how to be real DJs every spare moment they had. They found a bar nearby with a DJ booth and they’d play for free all night, every night they could. </p>\n<p>“It was our job and our duty to make sure we knew that technical side, to understand the art of DJing and music and producing,” says Breezy. “That way, no one could say shit, because we were going to be great at it.”</p>\n<p>Since then, they’ve become DJs with tracks like<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34ol7Eg0ZMHBlBYlz6oeFO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>Convo</em></a><span> </span>and<span> </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2LNOZyp2FX1ARZXc5gf3hB?highlight=spotify:track:64NGjHW1w5Kl42xEKdqi6o" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>U.</em></a>, doing sets whenever they can while splitting their time between NYC and LA (the bicoastal life was a COVID change, which also includes a new puppy named Isis). </p>\n<p>The fake palm tree in their Manhattan showroom is perhaps now a reminder of their West Coast second home. It sits amongst glasses, glasses everywhere; a 3D printer for experimentation with new frame designs; desks for sketching, dreaming, and working hard.</p>\n<p><img alt="An image of Coco and Breezy working on a new design in their workshop" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image5_4a50db9e-3c72-4c45-b7b9-63d5b31dba07.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647492506" class=" lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/image5_4a50db9e-3c72-4c45-b7b9-63d5b31dba07.png?format=webp&amp;v=1647492506"></p>\n<h2>Serial entrepreneurs</h2>\n<p>Some people were quick to judge Coco and Breezy’s decision to focus on more than one business venture—especially when they also bought property in the Catskills and launched a retreat resort called<span> </span><a href="https://thelorca.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Lorca</a>.</p>\n<p>“Being women and women of color, I feel like we’re in this space of entrepreneurship where people are like, ‘You should only do this one thing,’” Breezy says.</p>\n<p>“But that’s because<span> </span><em>they</em><span> </span>can’t do it,” Coco adds. “So in their head, they’re just putting their ways onto you, their fear of like, ‘How are you able to manage all of this?’ But just because you can’t do it, don’t put that shit on me.

I can be an entrepreneur?’ It’s not just a white man in a suit.”</p>\n<p>And so they both proudly claim the title of<span> </span><em>entrepreneur</em>, to show that there is no single way to be one.</p>\n<p>So what other passions are the twins yet to pursue?</p>\n<p>“It’s my dream to be a superhero in a movie,” Breezy says, and Coco agrees, their knees brushing against one another on the green couch, never interrupting each other, each giving the other time to speak, not completing each other’s sentences as the twin cliché would dictate. They’ve previously mentioned that they believe someday, someone will write a book about them, and it will turn into a movie. </p>\n<p>“Or a cartoon character that models the story behind our story,” Breezy adds. “There’s not a lot of inspiring cartoons you see of young Black girls that don’t make a mockery of our culture. You don’t see a Black girl running a company. And so I think I’m going to manifest it. Some young Black twins who wanted to start a business, who didn’t come from a lot. Who started a billion dollar company, who were the biggest DJs—I’m manifesting my life and it’s going to be able to inspire other young kids.”</p>\n<p>If what Coco and Breezy have already been able to manifest are any indication, that cartoon will be soon coming to a screen near you. </p>\n<div class="marketing-block marketing-block--blue marketing-block--padded">\n<p><strong>Coco and Breezy’s financial advice: Buy property</strong></p>\n<p>“As black women, it’s important for us to own property, because we’ve been deprived of home ownership,” Coco says. </p>\n<p>Even if it’s not financially possible on your own, band together with friends and invest together. That’s what Coco and Breezy did with two partners. Their property in the Catskills includes five houses, and they’ve now expanded to a property in the Adirondacks as well. </p>\n<p>Where did the money come from to purchase the land?</p>\n<p>“We do a lot of influencer work,” Coco says. “That’s easy, big money. We did a Pandora campaign, and a Tommy Hilfiger campaign, maybe one more, and we acted like we didn’t see that money. We just put that towards buying our first property, instead of buying designer.</p>\n<p>“I want to tell all the young people that are making influencer money: save your money and buy property or invest it in something. Don’t spend all your money on material things.”</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Coco’s advice for entrepreneurs</strong></p>\n<p>“One thing I’ve learned is that to be a CEO, you don’t need to know everything. And I think that’s often what stops people from starting companies, because they feel like, ‘Oh my gosh, if I want to be a CEO or founder, I need to know everything.’</p>\n<p>“But guess what? You’re the person with the big ideas. You’re the person that’s driving and leading your team. You’re the person who’s going to do the research for what you don’t know. (Entrepreneur) Ben Horwitz taught me that, and it changed my whole life.</p>\n<p>“I don’t need to know everything. I will be open-minded to learn what I don’t know. But I’m not going to stop myself because I feel insecure about walking into a room not knowing certain things.”</p>\n<p><strong>Breezy’s advice for entrepreneurs</strong></p>\n<p>“Starting a company and being an entrepreneur isn’t for everybody. And failure is okay. You have to try something out before you assume it will or won’t work. I think a lot of times as entrepreneurs and creators, we get so stuck on this one idea, and it’s okay to have a vision, but it’s also okay to have a little wiggle room and be able to pivot. As long as it’s coming from the heart, and that pivot is going to be true to yourself.”</p>\n<p><strong>Finding their unique identities</strong></p>\n<p>Getting bullied growing up, Coco and Breezy became inseparable—they were often each other’s only friend. And that showed up when they started their business too: they shared an email address, would answer emails together, would walk to the mail together to ship a package.</p>\n<p>But they realized they weren’t going to grow if they were both doing the same things. So they took a hard look at themselves. Who was Corianna? Who was Brianna? Not Coco and Breezy; that part was easy. But who were they individually? That led to Breezy identifying as the creative rock-star risk-taker who leads design, and Coco as the self-proclaimed “mom” who focuses on marketing and operational growth.</p>\n<p>Now that the two realize how different they are, it’s much easier to divide and conquer.</p>\n<p>“Our duality together works great because we’re different,” Coco says. “We’re like the ying and the yang.”</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>This piece originally appeared in the print edition of </em><a href="https://magazine.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shopify Magazine</em></a><em>.
